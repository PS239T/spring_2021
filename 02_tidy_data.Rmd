# Tidy data and its friends {#tidy_data}

## Setup

-   Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}

ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") > 1,
  "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr")
)

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # for the tidyverse framework
  here, # for computational reproducibility
  gapminder, # toy data
  nycflights13 # for exercise
)
```

## R Data structures 

To make the best use of the R language, you'll need a strong understanding of the basic data types and data structures and how to operate on those. R is an **object-oriented** language, so the importance of this cannot be understated. 

It is **critical** to understand because these are the objects you will manipulate on a day-to-day basis in R, and they are not always as easy to work with as they sound at the outset. Dealing with object conversions is one of the most common sources of frustration for beginners.

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
  - Everything that exists is an object.
  - Everything that happens is a function call.

1. [Main Classes](#main-classes) introduces you to R's one-dimensional or atomic classes and data structures. R has five basic atomic classes: logical, integer, numeric, complex, character. Social scientists don't use complex class. (Also, remember that we rarely use trigonometry.)

2. [Attributes](#attributes) takes a small detour to discuss attributes, R's flexible metadata specification. Here you'll learn about factors, an important data structure created by setting attributes of an atomic vector. R has many data structures: vector, list, matrix, data frame, factors, tables.

## 1D data: Vectors 

### Atomic classes

`R`'s main atomic classes are:

* character (or a "string" in Python and Stata)
* numeric (integer or float)
* integer (just integer)
* logical (booleans)

| Example | Type |
| ------- | ---- |
| "a", "swc" | character |
| 2, 15.5 | numeric | 
| 2 (Must add a `L` at end to denote integer) | integer |
| `TRUE`, `FALSE` | logical |

Like Python, R is dynamically typed. There are a few differences in terminology, however, that are pertinent. 

- First, "types" in Python are referred to as "classes" in R. 

- Second, R has some different names for the types string, integer, and float --- specifically **character**, **integer** (not different), and **numeric**. Because there is no "float" class in R, users tend to default to the "numeric" class when they want to work with numerical data.

The function for recovering object classes is ```class()```. L suffix to qualify any number with the intent of making it an explicit integer. See more from the [R language definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html).

```{r}
class(3)
class(3L)
class("Three")
class(F)
```

### Data structures

R's base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they're homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). This gives rise to the five data types most often used in data analysis: 

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

Each data structure has its own specifications and behavior. For our purposes, an important thing to remember is that R is always **faster** (more efficient) working with homogenous (**vectorized**) data.

#### Vector properties

Vectors have three common properties:

* Class, `class()`, or what type of object it is (same as `type()` in Python).
* Length, `length()`, how many elements it contains (same as `len()` in Python).
* Attributes, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.

They differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

#### Creating different types of atomic vectors

Remember, there are four common types of vectors: 
* `logical` 
* `integer` 
* `numeric` (same as `double`)
* `character`.

You can create an empty vector with `vector()` (By default the mode is `logical`. You can be more explicit as shown in the examples below.) It is more common to use direct constructors such as `character()`, `numeric()`, etc.

```{r}

x <- vector()

# with a length and type
vector("character", length = 10)

## character vector of length 5
character(5)

numeric(5)

logical(5)
```

Atomic vectors are usually created with `c()`, which is short for concatenate:

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)

x

length(x)
```

`x` is a numeric vector. These are the most common kind. You can also have logical vectors. 

```{r}

y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

y
```

Finally you can have character vectors:

```{r}

kim_family <- c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane")

is.integer(kim_family) # integer?

is.character(kim_family) # character?

is.atomic(kim_family) # atomic?

typeof(kim_family) # what's the type?
```

**Short exercise: Create and examine your vector**  

Create a character vector called `fruit` that contain 4 of your favorite fruits. Then evaluate its structure using the commands below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# First create your fruit vector
# YOUR CODE HERE
fruit <-

  # Examine your vector
  length(fruit)
class(fruit)
str(fruit)
```

**Add elements**

You can add elements to the end of a vector by passing the original vector into the `c` function, like so:

```{r}

z <- c("Beyonce", "Kelly", "Michelle", "LeToya")

z <- c(z, "Farrah")

z
```

More examples of vectors

```{r}

x <- c(0.5, 0.7)

x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

x <- 9:100
```

You can also create vectors as a sequence of numbers:

```{r}

series <- 1:10

series

seq(10)

seq(1, 10, by = 0.1)
```

Atomic vectors are always flat, even if you nest `c()`'s:

```{r eval = TRUE}

c(1, c(2, c(3, 4)))

# the same as
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

**Types and Tests**

Given a vector, you can determine its class with `class`, or check if it's a specific type with an "is" function: `is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`, or, more generally, `is.atomic()`.

```{r }

char_var <- c("harry", "sally")

class(char_var)

is.character(char_var)

is.atomic(char_var)

num_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)

class(num_var)

is.numeric(num_var)

is.atomic(num_var)
```

NB: `is.vector()` does not test if an object is a vector. Instead it returns `TRUE` only if the object is a vector with no attributes apart from names. Use `is.atomic(x) || is.list(x)` to test if an object is actually a vector.

**Coercion**

All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to combine different types they will be __coerced__ to the most flexible type. Types from least to most flexible are: logical, integer, double, and character. 

For example, combining a character and an integer yields a character:

```{r}
str(c("a", 1))
```

**Guess what the following do without running them first**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

c(1.7, "a")

c(TRUE, 2)

c("a", TRUE)
```

Notice that when a logical vector is coerced to an integer or double, `TRUE` becomes 1 and `FALSE` becomes 0. This is very useful in conjunction with `sum()` and `mean()`

```{r}

x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

as.numeric(x)

# Total number of TRUEs
sum(x)

# Proportion that are TRUE
mean(x)
```

Coercion often happens automatically. This is called implicit coercion. Most mathematical functions (`+`, `log`, `abs`, etc.) will coerce to a numeric or integer, and most logical operations (`&`, `|`, `any`, etc) will coerce to a logical. You will usually get a warning message if the coercion might lose information. 

```{r}

1 < "2"

"1" > 2
```

You can also coerce vectors explicitly coerce with `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()`. Example:

```{r}

x <- 0:6

as.numeric(x)

as.logical(x)

as.character(x)
```

Sometimes coercions, especially nonsensical ones, wonâ€™t work.

```{r}

x <- c("a", "b", "c")

as.numeric(x)

as.logical(x)
```

**Short Exercise**

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# 1. Create a vector of a sequence of numbers between 1 to 10.

# 2. Coerce that vector into a character vector

# 3. Add the element "11" to the end of the vector

# 4. Coerce it back to a numeric vector.
```

#### Lists

Lists are also vectors, but different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type. In short, they are generic vectors. You construct lists by using `list()` instead of `c()`: 

Lists are sometimes called recursive vectors, because a list can contain other lists. This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors. 

```{r}

x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, c(4, 5, 6))

x
```

You can coerce other objects using `as.list()`. You can test for a list with `is.list()`

```{r}

x <- 1:10

x <- as.list(x)

is.list(x)

length(x)
```

`c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, `c()` (con**c**atenate) will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them. Compare the results of `list()` and `c()`:

```{r}

x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

str(x)

str(y)
```

You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. If the elements of a list have different types, `unlist()` uses the same coercion rules as `c()`.

```{r}

x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

x

unlist(x)
```

Lists are used to build up many of the more complicated data structures in R. For example, both data frames and linear models objects (as produced by `lm()`) are lists:

```{r}

is.list(mtcars)

mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

is.list(mod)
```

For this reason, lists are extremely useful inside functions. You can "staple" together lots of different kinds of results into a single object that a function can return.

A list does not print to the console like a vector. Instead, each element of the list starts on a new line.

```{r}
x.vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
x.list <- list(1, 2, 3)
x.vec
x.list
```

For lists, elements are **indexed by double brackets**. Single brackets will still return a(nother) list. (We'll talk more about subsetting and indexing in the fourth lesson.)

**Exercises**

1. What are the four basic types of atomic vector? How does a list differ from an
   atomic vector?

2. Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `"one" < 2` false?

3. Create three vectors and then combine them into a list.

4.  If `x` is a list, what is the class of `x[1]`?  How about `x[[1]]`?


### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about the data to you, the user, and to R. We've already seen the following three attributes in action:

* Names (`names(x)`), a character vector giving each element a name. 

* Dimensions (`dim(x)`), used to turn vectors into matrices.

* Class (`class(x)`), used to implement the S3 object system.

**Tips**
In an object-oriented system, a [class](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+class+programming&oq=what+is+class+programming&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3543j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (an extensible problem-code-template) defines a type of objects like what its properties are, how it behaves, and how it relates to other types of objects. Therefore, technically, an object is an [instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) (or occurrence) of a class. A method is a function associated with a particular type of object.

#### Names

You can name a vector when you create it:

```{r}

x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```

You can also modifying an existing vector: 

```{r}

x <- 1:3

names(x)

names(x) <- c("e", "f", "g")

names(x)
```

Names don't have to be unique. However, character subsetting, described in the next lesson, is the most important reason to use names and it is most useful when the names are unique. (For Python users: when names are unique, a vector behaves kind of like a Python dictionary key.)

Not all elements of a vector need to have a name. If some names are missing, `names()` will return an empty string for those elements. If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`.

```{r}

y <- c(a = 1, 2, 3)

names(y)

z <- c(1, 2, 3)

names(z)
```

You can create a new vector without names using `unname(x)`, or remove names in place with `names(x) <- NULL`.

#### Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered (ordinal variable) or unordered (nominal or categorical variable) and are important for modeling functions such as `lm()` and `glm()` and also in plot methods.

**Quiz**
1. If you want to enter dummy variables (Democrats = 1, Non-democrats = 0) in your regression model, should you use numeric or factor variable?

Factors can only contain pre-defined values. Set allowed values using the `levels()` attribute. Note that a factor's levels will always be character values. 


```{r}

x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")

x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))

x

class(x)

levels(x)

# You can't use values that are not in the levels
x[2] <- "c"

# NB: you can't combine factors
c(factor("a"), factor("b"))

rep(1:5, rep(6, 5))
```

Factors are pretty much integers that have labels on them. Underneath, it's really numbers (1, 2, 3...). 

```{r}

x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))

str(x)
```

They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are what are called self describing. For example, `democrat` and `republican` is more descriptive than `1`s and `2`s. 

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take, even if you don't see all values in a given dataset. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:

```{r}

party_char <- c("democrat", "democrat", "democrat")

party_char

party_factor <- factor(party_char, levels = c("democrat", "republican"))

party_factor

table(party_char) # shows only democrats

table(party_factor) # shows republicans too
```

Sometimes factors can be left unordered. Example: `democrat`, `republican`.

Other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked). Example: `low`, `medium`, `high`. 

```{r}

x <- factor(c("low", "medium", "high"))

str(x)

is.ordered(x)

y <- ordered(c("low", "medium", "high"), levels = c("high", "medium", "low"))

is.ordered(y)
```

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers. Be careful when treating them like strings. Some string methods (like `gsub()` and `grepl()`) will coerce factors to strings, while others (like `nchar()`) will throw an error, and still others (like `c()`) will use the underlying integer values. 

```{r}

x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")

x

is.factor(x)

x <- as.factor(x)

x

c(x, "c")
```

For this reason, it's usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour. In early versions of R, there was a memory advantage to using factors instead of character vectors, but this is no longer the case.

Unfortunately, most data loading functions in R automatically convert character vectors to factors. This is suboptimal, because there's no way for those functions to know the set of all possible levels or their optimal order. If this becomes a problem, use the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behaviour, and then manually convert character vectors to factors using your knowledge of the data.

**More attributes**

All R objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object. Attributes can be thought of as a named list (with unique names). Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once (as a list) with `attributes()`. 

```{r}

y <- 1:10

attr(y, "my_attribute") <- "This is a vector"

attr(y, "my_attribute")

# str returns a new object with modified information
str(attributes(y))
```

**Exercises**

1.  What happens to a factor when you modify its levels? 
    
```{r, results = "none"}

f1 <- factor(letters)

levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))

f1
```

2.  What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?

```{r, results = "none"}

f2 <- rev(factor(letters))

f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
```

## 2D data: matrices and dataframes 

1. Matrices:  data structures for storing 2d data that is all the same class.
2. Dataframes: teaches you about the dataframe, the most important data structure for storing data in R, because it stores different kinds of (2d) data.

### Matrices

Matrices are created when we combine multiple vectors that all have the same class (e.g., numeric). This creates a dataset with rows and columns. By definition, if you want to combine multiple classes of vectors, you want a dataframe. You can coerce a matrix to become a dataframe, and vice-versa, but as with all vector coercions, the results can be unpredictable, so be sure you know how each variable (column) will convert.

```{r}

m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

m

dim(m)
```

Matrices are filled column-wise. 

```{r}

m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

m
```

Other ways to construct a matrix

```{r}

m <- 1:10

dim(m) <- c(2, 5)

m

dim(m) <- c(5, 2)

m
```

You can transpose a matrix (or dataframe) with `t()`

```{r}

m <- 1:10

dim(m) <- c(2, 5)

m

t(m)
```

Another way is to bind columns or rows using `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```{r}

x <- 1:3

y <- 10:12

cbind(x, y)

# or

rbind(x, y)
```

You can also use the `byrow` argument to specify how the matrix is filled. From R's own documentation:

```{r}

mdat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 3,
  byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(
    c("row1", "row2"),
    c("C.1", "C.2", "C.3")
  )
)
mdat
```   

Notice that we gave `names` to the dimentions in `mdat`.

```{r}

dimnames(mdat)

rownames(mdat)

colnames(mdat)
```

### Dataframes 

A data frame is a very important data type in R. It's pretty much the **de facto** data structure for most tabular data and what we use for statistics. 

#### Creation

You create a data frame using `data.frame()`, which takes named vectors as input:

```{r}
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)
df
str(df)
```

Beware: `data.frame()`'s default behavior which turns strings into factors. Remember to use `stringAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behavior as needed:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
str(df)
```

In reality, we rarely type up our datasets ourselves, and certainly not in R. The most common way to make a data.frame is by calling a file using `read.csv` (which relies on the `foreign` package), `read.dta` (if you're using a Stata file), or some other kind of data file input.

#### Structure and Attributes

Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the matrix and the list. 

```{r}
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

str(df)
```

This means that a dataframe has `names()`, `colnames()`, and `rownames()`, although `names()` and `colnames()` are the same thing. 

** Summary **

- Set column names: names() in data frame, colnames() in matrix 
- Set row names: row.names() in data frame, rownames() in matrix

```{r}
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

# these two are equivalent
names(df)
colnames(df)

# change the colnames
colnames(df) <- c("Number", "Character")
df
```

```{r}
names(df) <- c("Number", "Character")
df
```

```{r}
# change the rownames
rownames(df)
rownames(df) <- c("donut", "pickle", "pretzel")
df
```

The `length()` of a dataframe is the length of the underlying list and so is the same as `ncol()`; `nrow()` gives the number of rows. 

```{r}
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

# these two are equivalent - number of columns
length(df)

ncol(df)

# get number of rows
nrow(df)

# get number of both columns and rows
dim(df)
```

#### Testing and coercion

To check if an object is a dataframe, use `class()` or test explicitly with `is.data.frame()`:

```{r}
class(df)
is.data.frame(df)
```

You can coerce an object to a dataframe with `as.data.frame()`:

* A vector will create a one-column dataframe.

* A list will create one column for each element; it's an error if they're 
  not all the same length.
  
* A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and rows as the matrix.

#### Combining dataframes

You can combine dataframes using `cbind()` and `rbind()`:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

cbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1))
rbind(df, data.frame(x = 10, y = "z"))
```

When combining column-wise, the number of rows must match, but row names are ignored. When combining row-wise, both the number and names of columns must match. (If you want to combine rows that don't have the same columns, there are other functions / packages in R that can help.)

It's a common mistake to try and create a dataframe by `cbind()`ing vectors together. This doesn't work because `cbind()` will create a matrix unless one of the arguments is already a dataframe. Instead use `data.frame()` directly:

```{r}
bad <- (cbind(x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b")))
bad
str(bad)

good <- data.frame(
  x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
good
str(good)
```

The conversion rules for `cbind()` are complicated and best avoided by ensuring all inputs are of the same type.

#### List columns (TBD)

**Other objects**

Missing values are specified with `NA`, which is a logical vector of length 1. `NA` will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside `c()`

```{r}
x <- c(NA, 1)
x
typeof(NA)
typeof(x)
```

`Inf` is infinity. You can have either positive or negative infinity.

```{r}
1 / 0
1 / Inf
```

`NaN` means Not a number. It's an undefined value.

```{r}
0 / 0
```

## Subset

When working with data, you'll need to subset objects early and often. Luckily, R's subsetting operators are powerful and fast. Mastery of subsetting allows you to succinctly express complex operations in a way that few other languages can match. Subsetting is hard to learn because you need to master a number of interrelated concepts:

* The three subsetting operators, `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

* Important differences in behavior for different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).

* The use of subsetting in conjunction with assignment.

This unit helps you master subsetting by starting with the simplest type of subsetting: subsetting an atomic vector with `[`. It then gradually extends your knowledge, first to more complicated data types (like dataframes and lists), and then to the other subsetting operators, `[[` and `$`. You'll then learn how subsetting and assignment can be combined to modify parts of an object, and, finally, you'll see a large number of useful applications.

### Atomic vectors

Let's explore the different types of subsetting with a simple vector, `x`. 

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
```

Note that the number after the decimal point gives the original position in the vector.

**NB:** In R, positions start at 1, unlike Python, which starts at 0. Fun!**

There are five things that you can use to subset a vector: 

#### Positive integers

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x
x[1]
x[c(3, 1)]

# `order(x)` gives the positions of smallest to largest values.
order(x)
x[order(x)]
x[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]

# Duplicated indices yield duplicated values
x[c(1, 1)]
```

#### Negative integers

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[-1]
x[-c(3, 1)]
```

You can't mix positive and negative integers in a single subset:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[c(-1, 2)]
```

#### Logical vectors

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# this returns a logical vector
x > 3
x

# use a conditional statement to create an implicit logical vector
x[x > 3]
```

You can combine conditional statements with `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not)

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# combing two conditional statements with &
x > 3 & x < 5


x[x > 3 & x < 5]

# combing two conditional statements with |
x < 3 | x > 5
x[x < 3 | x > 5]

# combining conditional statements with !
!x > 5
x[!x > 5]
```

Another way to generate implicit conditional statements is using the `%in%` operator, which works like the `in` keywords in Python.

```{r}
# generate implicit logical vectors through the %in% operator
x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)
x
x[x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)]
```

#### Character vectors

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# apply names
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x

# subset using names
x[c("d", "c", "a")]

# Like integer indices, you can repeat indices
x[c("a", "a", "a")]

# Careful! names are always matched exactly
x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2)
x
x[c("a", "d")]
```

#### Lists

Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using `[` will always return a list; `[[` and `$`, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.

```{r}
l <- list("a" = 1, "b" = 2)
l

l[1]
l[[1]]
l["a"]
```

#### Matrices

The most common way of subsetting matrices (2d) is a simple generalization of 1d subsetting: you supply a 1d index for each dimension, separated by a comma. Blank subsetting is now useful because it lets you keep all rows or all columns.

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) <- c("A", "B", "C")
a

# rows come first, then columns
a[c(1, 2), ]
a[c(T, F, T), c("B", "A")]
a[0, -2]
a[c(1, 2), -2]
```

#### Data frames

Data from data frames can be addressed like matrices (with row and column indicators separated by a comma).

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 4:6, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])
df

# return only the rows where x == 6
df[df$x == 6, ]

# return the first and third row
df[c(1, 3), ]

# return the first and third row, and the first and second column
df[c(1, 3), c(1, 2)]
```

Data frames possess the characteristics of both lists and matrices: if you subset with a single vector, they behave like lists, and return only the columns.

```{r}
# There are two ways to select columns from a data frame
# Like a list:
df[c("x", "z")]
# Like a matrix
df[, c("x", "z")]
```

But there's an important difference when you select a single column: matrix subsetting simplifies by default, list subsetting does not.

```{r}
(df["x"])
class((df["x"]))

(df[, "x"])
class((df[, "x"]))
```

See the bottom section on [Simplying and Preserving to know more](#simplify-preserve)

#### Subsetting operators 

There are two other subsetting operators: `[[` and `$`. 

* `[[` is similar to `[`, except it can only return a single value and it allows you to pull pieces out of a list. 
* `$` is a useful shorthand for `[[` combined with character subsetting. 

##### `[[`

You need `[[` when working with lists. This is because when `[` is applied to a list it always returns a list: it never gives you the contents of the list. To get the contents, you need `[[`:

>  "If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is
> the object in car 5; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6." 
>
> --- @RLangTip

Because data frames are lists of columns, you can use `[[` to extract a column from data frames:

```{r}
mtcars

# these two are equivalent
mtcars[[1]]
mtcars[, 1]

# which differs from this:
mtcars[1]
```

##### `$`

`$` is a shorthand operator, where `x$y` is equivalent to `x[["y", exact = FALSE]]`.  It's often used to access variables in a data frame:

```{r}
# these two are equivalent
mtcars[["cyl"]]
mtcars$cyl
```

One common mistake with `$` is to try and use it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable:

```{r}
var <- "cyl"
# Doesn't work - mtcars$var translated to mtcars[["var"]]
mtcars$var

# Instead use [[
mtcars[[var]]
```

#### Subassignment

All subsetting operators can be combined with assignment to modify selected values of the input vector.

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- 1:5
x
x[c(1, 2)] <- 2:3
x

# The length of the LHS needs to match the RHS!
x[-1] <- 4:1
x

x[1] <- 4:1

# This is mostly useful when conditionally modifying vectors
df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 10, NA))
df
df$a[df$a < 5] <- 0
df
```

Peng.

-   [Tidyverse design guide](https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying-principles.html)

    -   Human centered

    -   Consistent

    -   Composable (modualized)

    -   Inclusive

    -   Influenced by the [Basics of the Unix Philosophy](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html), [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), and the [Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://refs.devinmcgloin.com/smalltalk/Design-Principles-Behind-Smalltalk.pdf)

## Tidy data

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

If dataframes are tidy, it's easy to transform, visualize, model, and program them using tidyverse packages (a whole workflow).

![Tidyverse: an opinionated collection of R packages](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*mlPyX0NE0WQwEzpS.png)

-   Nevertheless, don't be **religious**.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what a tidy data looks like.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

table1
```

- The big picture 
    - Tidying data with **tidyr**
    - Processing data with **dplyr**
    
These two packages don't do anything new, but simplify most common tasks in data manipulation. Plus, they are fast, consistent, and more readable.

Practically, this approach is good because you're going to have consistency in the format of data across all the projects you're working on. Also, tidy data works well with key packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2) in R.

Computationally, this approach is useful for vectorized programming because "different variables from the same observation are always paired". To remind you, vectorized means a function applies to a vector treats each element individually.

### Reshaping

**Signs of messy datasets**

* 1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
* 2. Multiple variables are not stored in one column.
* 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
* 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
* 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

Let's take a look at the cases of untidy data.

![Messy Data Case 1 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-5.png)

-   Make It Longer

    | Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
    |------|------|------|
    |      |      |      |
    |      |      |      |
    |      |      |      |

**Challenge**: Why this data is not tidy?

```{r}

table4a
```

-   Let's pivot (rotate by 90 degree).

-   [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) increases the number of rows (longer) and decreases the number of columns. The inverse function is `pivot_wider()`. These functions improve the usability of `gather()` and `spread()`.

![What pivot\_longer() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-longer-image.png)

- The pipe operator `%>%` originally comes from the `magrittr` package. The idea behind the pipe operator is [similar to](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial) what we learned about chaining functions in high school. f: B -> C and g: A -> B can be expressed as $f(g(x))$. Basically, the pipe operator chains operations. 

```{r}

# Old way, less intuitive
table4a %>%
  gather(
    key = "cases", # Current column names
    value = "year", # The values matched to cases
    c("1999", "2000")
  ) # Selected columns
```

```{r}

# New way, more intuitive
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Selected columns
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases"
  ) # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
```

-   There's another problem, did you catch it?

-   The data type of `year` variable should be `numeric` not `character`. By default, `pivot_longer()` transforms uninformative columns to character.

-   You can fix this problem by using `names_transform` argument.

```{r}

table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Put two columns together
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases", # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
    names_transform = list(year = readr::parse_number)
  ) # Transform the variable
```

**Additional tips**

`parse_number()` also keeps only numeric information in a variable.

```{r}

parse_number("reply1994")
```

A flat file (e.g., CSV) is a rectangular shaped combination of strings. [Parsing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/vignettes/readr.html) determines the type of each column and turns into a vector of a more specific type. Tidyverse has `parse_` functions (from `readr` package) that are flexible and fast (e.g., `parse_integer()`, `parse_double()`, `parse_logical()`, `parse_datetime()`, `parse_date()`, `parse_time()`, `parse_factor()`, etc).

-   Let's do another practice.

**Challenge**

1.  Why this data is not tidy? (This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).) Too long or too wide?

```{r}

billboard
```

2.  How can you fix it? Which pivot?

```{r}

# Old way
billboard %>%
  gather(
    key = "week",
    value = "rank",
    starts_with("wk")
  ) %>% # Use regular expressions
  drop_na() # Drop NAs
```

-   Note that `pivot_longer()` is more versatile than `gather()`.

```{r}

# New way
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), # Use regular expressions
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE # Drop NAs
  )
```

-   Make It Wider

-   Why this data is not tidy?

```{r}
table2
```

-   Each observation is spread across two rows.

-   How can you fix it?: `pivot_wider()`.

**Two differences between `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`**

-   In `pivot_longer()`, the arguments are named `names_to` and `values_to` (*to*).

-   In `pivot_wider()`, this pattern is opposite. The arguments are named `names_from` and `values_from` (*from*).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_longer()` is 3 (col, names\_to, values\_to).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_wider()` is 2 (names\_from, values\_from).

![What pivot\_wider() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-wider-image.png)

```{r}

# Old way
table2 %>%
  spread(
    key = type,
    value = count
  )
```

```{r}
# New way
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = type, # first
    values_from = count # second
  )
```

Sometimes, a consultee came to me and asked: "I don't have missing values in my original dataframe. Then R said that I have missing values after I've done some data transformations. What happened?"

Here's an answer.

R defines missing values in two ways.

-   *Implicit missing values*: simply not present in the data.

-   *Explicit missing values*: flagged with NA

**Challenge**

The example comes from [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

```{r}


stocks <- tibble(
  year = c(2019, 2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2020),
  qtr = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4),
  return = c(1, 2, 3, NA, 2, 3)
)

stocks
```

-   Where is explicit missing value?

-   Does `stocks` have implicit missing values?

```{r}
# implicit missing values become explicit
stocks %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = return
  )
```

**Challenge**

-   This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).

-   Could you make `station` a series of dummy variables using `pivot_wider()`?

```{r}
fish_encounters
```

1.  Which pivot you should use?

2.  Are there explicit missing values?

3.  How could you turn these NAs into 0s? Check `values_fill` argument in the `pivot_wider()` function.

-   Separate

![Messy Data Case 2 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-6.png)

```{r}

# Toy example
df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "Dad.apple", "Mom.orange", "Daughter.banana"))

df
```

```{r}

# Separate
df %>%
  separate(x, into = c("Name", "Preferred_fruit"))

# Don't need the first variable

df %>%
  separate(x, into = c(NA, "Preferred_fruit"))
```

**Practice**

```{r}
table3
```

-   Note `sep` argument. You can specify how to separate joined values.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
    into = c("cases", "population"),
    sep = "/"
  )
```

-   Note `convert` argument. You can specify whether automatically convert the new values or not.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
    into = c("cases", "population"),
    sep = "/",
    convert = TRUE
  ) # cases and population become integers
```

-   Unite

`pivot_longer()` \<-\> `pivot_wider()`

`separate()` \<-\> `unite()`

```{r}

# Create a toy example
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane", NA),
  birthmonth = c("April", "April", "June", NA)
)

# Include missing values
df %>% unite(
  "contact",
  c("name", "birthmonth")
)

# Do not include missing values
df %>% unite("contact",
  c("name", "birthmonth"),
  na.rm = TRUE
)
```

### Filling (TBD)

## dplyr 

dplyr is better than the base R approaches to data processing:

- fast to run (due to the C++ backed) and intuitive to type
- works well with tidy data and databases

### Rearranging

-   Arrange

-   Order rows

```{r}

dplyr::arrange(mtcars, mpg) # Low to High (default)

dplyr::arrange(mtcars, desc(mpg)) # High to Row
```

-   Rename

-   Rename columns

```{r}

df <- tibble(y = c(2011, 2012, 2013))

df

df %>% rename(
  Year = # OLD name
  y
) # NEW name
```

### Subset observations (rows)

-   Choose row by logical condition

-   Single condition

```{r}

starwars %>%
  filter(gender == "female") %>%
  arrange(desc(height))
```

The following filtering example was inspired by [the suzanbert's dplyr blog post](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/02/dplyr-tutorial-3/).

-   Multiple conditions (numeric)

```{r}

# First example
starwars %>%
  filter(height < 180, height > 160) %>%
  nrow()

# Same as above
starwars %>%
  filter(height < 180 & height > 160) %>%
  nrow()

# Not same as above
starwars %>%
  filter(height < 180 | height > 160) %>%
  nrow()
```

**Challenge**

(1) Use `filter(between())` to find characters whose heights are between 180 and 160 and (2) count the number of these observations.

-   Minimum reproducible example

```{r}

df <- tibble(
  heights = c(160:180),
  char = rep("none", length(c(160:180)))
)

df %>%
  filter(between(heights, 161, 179))
```

-   Multiple conditions (character)

```{r}

# Filter names include ars; `grepl` is a base R function

starwars %>%
  filter(grepl("ars", tolower(name)))

# Or, if you prefer dplyr way

starwars %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(name), "ars"))

# Filter brown and black hair_color

starwars %>%
  filter(hair_color %in% c("black", "brown"))
```

**Challenge**

Use `str_detect()` to find characters whose names include "Han".

-   Choose row by position (row index)

```{r}

starwars %>%
  arrange(desc(height)) %>%
  slice(1:6)
```

-   Sample by fraction

```{r}

# For reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

# Old way

starwars %>%
  sample_frac(0.10,
    replace = FALSE
  ) # Without replacement

# New way

starwars %>%
  slice_sample(
    prop = 0.10,
    replace = FALSE
  )
```

-   Sample by number

```{r}

# Old way

starwars %>%
  sample_n(20,
    replace = FALSE
  ) # Without replacement

# New way

starwars %>%
  slice_sample(
    n = 20,
    replace = FALSE
  ) # Without replacement
```

-   Top 10 rows orderd by height

```{r}

# Old way
starwars %>%
  top_n(10, height)

# New way
starwars %>%
  slice_max(height, n = 10) # Variable first, Argument second
```

### Subset variables (columns)

```{r}

names(msleep)
```

-   Select only numeric columns

```{r}

# Only numeric
msleep %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))
```

**Challenge**

Use `select(where())` to find only non-numeric columns

-   Select the columns that include "sleep" in their names

```{r}

msleep %>%
  select(contains("sleep"))
```

-   Select the columns that include either "sleep" or "wt" in their names

-   Basic R way

`grepl` is one of the R base pattern matching functions.

```{r}

msleep[grepl("sleep|wt", names(msleep))]
```

**Challenge**

Use `select(match())` to find columns whose names include either "sleep" or "wt".

-   Select the columns that starts with "b"

```{r}

msleep %>%
  select(starts_with("b"))
```

-   Select the columns that ends with "wt"

```{r}

msleep %>%
  select(ends_with("wt"))
```

-   Select the columns using both beginning and end string patterns

The key idea is you can use Boolean operators (`!`, `&`, `|`)to combine different string pattern matching statements.

```{r}

msleep %>%
  select(starts_with("b") & ends_with("wt"))
```

-   Select order and move it before everything

```{r}

# By specifying a column
msleep %>%
  select(order, everything())
```

-   Select variables from a character vector.

```{r}

msleep %>%
  select(any_of(c("name", "order"))) %>%
  colnames()
```

-   Select the variables named in the character + number pattern

```{r}

msleep$week8 <- NA

msleep$week12 <- NA

msleep$week_extra <- 0

msleep %>%
  select(num_range("week", c(1:12)))
```

### Create variables (TBD)

### Rename variables (TBD)

#### Clean names (TBD)

### Recode values (TBD)

### Counting

-   How may countries in each continent?

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  count(continent)
```

-   Let's arrange the result.

```{r}

# Just add a new argument `sort = TRUE`
gapminder %>%
  count(continent, sort = TRUE)

# Same as above; How nice!
gapminder %>%
  count(continent) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

**Challenge**

Count the number of observations per `continent` as well as `year` and arrange them with descending order.

Let's take a deeper look at how things work under the hood.

-   `tally()` works similar to `nrow()`: Calculate the total number of cases in a dataframe

-   `count` = `group_by()` + `tally()`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  tally()
```

-   `add_tally()` = `mutate(n = n())`

**Challenge**

What does n in the below example represent?

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  select(continent, country) %>%
  add_tally()
```

-   `add_count`

Add count as a column

```{r}

# Add count as a column
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  add_count(year)
```

**Challenge**

Do the cases 1 and 2 in the below code chunk produce same outputs? If so, why?

```{r}

# Case 1
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  count()

# Case 2
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  count(year)
```

### Summarizing

#### Basic

-   Create a summary

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdp = sd(gdpPercap)
  )

tablea <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdp = sd(gdpPercap)
  )
```

-   Produce publishable tables

```{r}

# For HTML and LaTeX
tablea %>% kableExtra::kable()

# For HTML and MS Office suite
tablea %>% flextable::flextable()
```

#### Scoped summaries

-   Old way

-   `summarise_all()`

```{r}

# Create a wide-shaped data example
wide_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = country,
    values_from = gdpPercap
  )

# Apply summarise_all
wide_gapminder %>%
  select(-c(1:4)) %>%
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

-   `summarise_if()`: using a logical condition

```{r}

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_if(is.double, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

-   `summarise_at()`

-   `vars() = select()`

```{r}

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_at(vars(-c(1:4)),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_at(vars(contains("life")),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

-   New way

-   `summarise()` + `across()`

-   If you find using `summarise_all()`, `summarise_if()` and `summarise_at()` confusing, here's a solution: use `summarise()` with `across()`.

-   `summarise_all()`

```{r}

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(Albania:`United Kingdom`, mean, na.rm = TRUE))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(-c(1:4), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

-   `summarise_if()`

```{r}

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(is.double, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

-   `summarise_at()`

```{r}

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(-c(1:4),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(contains("life"),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(contains("A", ignore.case = FALSE)))
```

Note that this workshop does not cover creating and manipulating variables using `mutate()` because many techniques you learned from playing with `summarise()` can be directly applied to `mutate()`.

**Challenge**

1.  Summarize average GDP of countries whose names starting with alphabet "A".

2.  Turn the summary dataframe into a publishable table using either `kableExtra` or `flextable` package.

#### Tabulization (TBD)

### Grouping

#### Grouped summaries

- Calculate the mean of `gdpPercap`.

- Some functions are designed to work together. For instance, the group_by
function defines the strata that you're going to use for summary statistics. Then, use summarise() or summarize() for producing summary statistics.

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap))
```

-   Calculate multiple summary statistics.

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    count = n()
  )
```

**Optional**

-   Other summary statistics

1.  Measures of spread: `median(x)`, `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)` (the median absolute deviation)

```{r}

# The Interquartile Range = The Difference Between 75t and 25t Percentiles

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(IQR_gdp = IQR(gdpPercap))
```

2.  Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(
    min_gdp = min(gdpPercap),
    max_gdp = max(gdpPercap)
  )
```

3.  Measures of position: `first(x)`, `last(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
    last_gdp = last(gdpPercap)
  )

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% # Adding arrange
  summarise(
    first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
    last_gdp = last(gdpPercap)
  )
```

4.  Measures of counts: `n(x)` (all rows), `sum(!is.na(x))` (only non-missing rows) = `n_distinct(x)`

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(ns = n())
```

5.  Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(condition about x)` (the number of TRUEs in x), `mean(condition about x)` (the proportion of TRUEs in x)

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(rich_countries = mean(gdpPercap > 20000))
```

### Nesting

#### nest

The following example comes from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) by by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

-   How can you run multiple models simultaneously? Using a nested data frame.

-   **Grouped data: each row = an observation**

-   **Nested data: each row = a group**

**Challenge**

In the following example, why did we use `country` and `continent` for nesting variables?

```{r}

nested <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>%
  nest()

head(nested)

nested$data[[1]]
```

-   Custom function

```{r}

lm_model <- function(df) {
  lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = df)
}
```

-   Apply function to the nested data

```{r}

# Apply m_model to the nested data

nested <- nested %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, lm_model)) # Add the list object as a new column

head(nested)
```

S3 is part of R's object oriented systems. If you need more information, check [this section](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html) in Hadley's Advanced R out.

#### unnest

`glance()` function from `broom` package inspects the quality of a statistical model.

**Additional tips**

-   `broom::glance(model)`: for evaluating model quality and/or complexity
-   `broom::tidy(model)`: for extracting each coefficient in the model (the estimates + its variability)
-   `broom::augment(model, data)`: for getting extra values (residuals, and influence statistics)

```{r}

glanced <- nested %>%
  mutate(glance = map(models, broom::glance))

glanced$glance[[1]]
```

`unnest()` unpacks the list objects stored in glance column

```{r}

glanced %>%
  unnest(glance) %>%
  arrange(BIC) # Low to High; Lower BIC indicates a better model fit

glanced %>%
  unnest(glance) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, BIC)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.5)
```

### Mapping

We tasted a little bit about how `map()` function works. Let's dig into it deeper as this family of functions is really useful. For more information, see Rebecca Barter's wonderful tutorial on the `purrr` package. In her words, this is "the tidyverse's answer to apply functions for iteration". `map()` function can take a vector (of any type), a list, and a dataframe for input.

```{r}

multiply <- function(x) {
  x * x
}

df <- list(
  first_obs = rnorm(7, 1, sd = 1),
  second_obs = rnorm(7, 2, sd = 2)
) # normal distribution
```

**Challenge**

Try `map_df(.x = df, .f = multiply)` and tell me what's the difference between the output you got and what you saw earlier.

### Joining

#### Mutating joins

> Add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another"

Using a simple toy example is great because it is easy to see how things work in that much narrow context.

-   Toy example

```{r}

# Table 1
x <- tibble(
  key = c(1:4),
  val_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4")
)

# Table 2
y <- tibble(
  key = c(1:5),
  val_y = c("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5")
)
```

-   Inner Join

`inner_join()` keeps the matched values in both tables. If the left table is a subset of the right table, then the result of `left_join()` is same as `inner_join()`.

**Challenge**

What are going to be the shared keys?

```{r}

inner_join(x, y)
```

![Mutating joins](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png)

-   Left Join

`left_join()`, `right_join()` and `full_join()` are outer join functions. Unlike `inner_join()`, outer join functions keep observations that appear in at least one of the tables.

`left_join()` keeps only the matched observations in the right table.

```{r}

left_join(x, y)
```

-   Right Join

`right_join()` does the opposite.

```{r}

right_join(x, y)
```

-   Full Join

`full_join()` keeps the observations from both tables. If they were unmatched, then NAs were recoded in one of the two tables.

```{r}

full_join(x, y)
```

#### Filtering joins

> Filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

-   Semi Join

In SQL, this type of query is also called subqueries.

-   Filtering without joining

```{r}

# Create the list of the top 10 destinations
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

# Filter
filtered <- flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)
```

-   Using semi join: only keep (INCLUDE) the rows that were matched between the two tables

```{r}

joined <- flights %>%
  semi_join(top_dest)

head(filtered == joined)
```

-   Anti Join

`anti_join()` dose the opposite. Exclude the rows that were matched between the two tables. Great technique to filter stopwords when you do a computational text analysis.

```{r}

flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
```
