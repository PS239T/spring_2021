Here's a list of books and papers related to PS239T that I found useful. 


## R

Gillespie, C. and Lovelace, R. (2017). [Efficienct R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). O'Reilly Media, Inc.

- If you don't have time to read the entire book, then read at laest ch.4 Efficient work flow. 

Grolemund, G. and Wickham, H. (2017). [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). O'Reilly Media, Inc.

- The book is accessible and also provides a strong foundation in R and programming in general. I strongly agree with their claim that "writing code is similar in many ways to writing prose".
