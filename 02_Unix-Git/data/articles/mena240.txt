"The United States plans to ask the Security Council to set up a commission to investigate possible Iraqi war crimes, the State Department said today. Secretary of State Warren Christopher also assured a group of Iraqi dissidents of support for a proposal to assign United Nations human rights monitors throughout the country. The United States is also urging the United Nations to try Serbian leaders on accusations of war crimes, following the precedent of the post-war trials of Nazi leaders in Germany."
