"To the Editor: In a May 1 news article on the torture death of a Palestinian detainee, you quote Israel's Environment Minister, Yossi Sarid, as saying: ""Shin Bet investigations are more crucial than ever because there are more of what we call ticking bombs in many places that only a quick investigation can neutralize,"" and ""it is completely clear that in the state of Israel torture during investigation is completely banned."" Yet a recent Human Rights Watch/ Middle East report observes that ""the repeated claim that 'pressure' was used against detainees because of the need to prevent murderous attacks"" is ""a mere pretext . . . in the overwhelming majority of cases in which detainees are tortured."" Further, as Mr. Sarid must know, the 1987 Landau Commission -- in the words of the Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories (B'Tselem) -- ""ended up legitimating the use of torture"" with its sanction of ""moderate physical force"": ""the use of torture and ill treatment follows logically from its recommendations."" Indeed, the one thing that is ""completely clear"" is that torture and ill treatment of Palestinian detainees are ""virtually institutionalized"" (Amnesty International), ""widespread and routine"" (B'Tselem), ""a systematic pattern"" ( Human Rights Watch).
