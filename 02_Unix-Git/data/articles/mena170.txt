"Amnesty International has issued a report asserting that the Israeli Government appears to have encouraged the killing of Palestinians in an effort to crush the uprising in the occupied territories. Israel denied the charge and said it had been more lenient than other nations in dealing with civil unrest. Amnesty International said that the guidelines for the use of firearms by Israeli troops permit unjustifiable killings of Palestinians and that abuses are not adequately investigated. ''We are concerned that, taken together, these factors appear to add up to more than just tolerance of serious abuses and amount to real encouragement of them,'' the human rights organization said in its January newsletter, made public on Wednesday. Their use of force has often been ''excessive and indiscriminate,'' it added. In response, the Justice Ministry in Jerusalem said that Israel ''is attempting to abide by the rules of international law and moral conduct in an area of the world where few other players even accept the rules. Unlike other nations that have recently faced civil disorders, Israel has not used the death penalty, show trials, lethal gas, massive deportations or forced migration,'' it said. ''Nor has it mowed down rioters with automatic weapons or sent tanks charging into crowds.''"
