"Canceled elections. A clumsy military coup. Mass arrests. And now a yearlong state of emergency. These dismaying steps by the ruling National Liberation Front in Algeria have been taken ostensibly to prevent a takeover by Islamic fundamentalists who were expected to sweep a runoff vote on Jan. 16. Such drastic repression is not only an affront to democracy, it is likely to radicalize an already aggrieved people and promote the very Islamic extremism that a rattled regime and its military backers seek to contain. This martial response to discontent is all too reminiscent of the ""dirty war"" waged by France against the National Liberation Front in the 1950's.  By jailing, torturing and slaying Algerians, France lost a war and made a revolution. And now the Liberation Front, corrupted by power it has refused to share since victory in 1962, descends into the same perilous defile. The Islamic Salvation Front is being denied a fair chance at the polls based on assumptions about its intentions, not its deeds. Those intentions may well be undemocratic, but it was not the Islamic opposition that brazenly voided the elections and pushed the nation toward extremism. Tellingly, the least fiery of the Islamic leaders were among the first to be detained, thus decapitating the opposition to the benefit of its extremists. And now, by proclaiming a year's emergency rule to stifle dissent, the Algerian junta has moved the struggle into the streets, the venue of violence. Repression and hysteria offer no remedy to the obvious discontent of jobless and hungry Algerians. Fear of fundamentalism does not justify reversing the gradual democratizing moves that since 1988 have given Algerians their first taste of political freedom. An ambivalent Washington and a worried France have hesitated to make plain their discomfort; the yearlong state of emergency should finally untie tongues."
