"Many governments are trying to reverse gains for women's rights, using concepts of women's ""special role"" to deny them equality and civil liberties, a human rights group said today. ""Some governments, among them Iran, the Holy See, India, Guatemala and Egypt, have threatened to roll back the gains for women's rights negotiated at previous conferences on human rights, population and social development,"" said the report from the group, Human Rights Watch. In a statement accompanying the global report on women's rights, Human Rights Watch said the idea that governments must respect women's rights in order to advance women's political, social and economic status was ""under siege."""
