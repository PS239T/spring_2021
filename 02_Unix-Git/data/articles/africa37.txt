"Milton Apollo Obote's second administration as president of Uganda has now ended like his first, with a military coup. The first revolt, in 1971, gave the beautiful East African country the nightmare of Idi Amin. The results this time are unlikely to be so blood-curdling; still, there seems little basis for optimism. For more than two decades, Mr. Obote has been responsible for most of Uganda's economic advances and most of its political debacles. The agricultural economy grew by more than 4 percent a year during his first rule in the 1960's, contracted throughout the capricious savagery of the Amin years and began to grow again, albeit more modestly, following Mr. Obote's return in 1980. But Mr. Obote permanently alienated the country's largest tribal group, the Baganda, when he sent in the army to crush their traditional autonomy in 1966. His partisans almost certainly rigged the election that returned him to power in 1980, and both Amnesty International and the State Department have since reported widespread violations of human rights, as his troops tried unsuccessfully to contain a guerrilla challenge. Still, it was neither Mr. Obote's principal victims nor his democratic opponents who brought him down, either then or now. Both times, trouble radiated from jealousies within the minority tribal groups in the military that were his main base of support. In 1971, Idi Amin struck soon after losing the post of army Chief of Staff. This time, Gen. Tito Okello, the new interim President, turned against Mr. Obote for failing to appoint him, or at least a member of his Acholi tribe, when that same position again became vacant. Thus the very commanders who could not defeat a guerrilla challenge or curb human rights violations by their subordinates will now rule Uganda, at least until the elections promised for next year. Perhaps reconciliation, recovery and respect for human rights will emerge from this coup, as promised. So far, it is hard to see how."
