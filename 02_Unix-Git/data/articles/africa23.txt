"Rights Group Says Gabonese Use Torture LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Amnesty International today accused security services in Gabon of using torture. The rights group said it had received persistent reports that Gabonese security officers were torturing prisoners with beatings, electrical devices and suffocation by prolonged immersion in water. An Amnesty report said 16 prisoners convicted in November 1982 of threatening state security and insulting President Omar Bongo had not received a fair trial. The prisoners are serving sentences of up to 12 years."
