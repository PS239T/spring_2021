"The Communist Governments in Eastern Europe had always managed to fend off censure of their regimes by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. But three months of martial law in Poland snapped the commission's patience and last week it called on the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to make a ''thorough study of the human rights situation in Poland'' and issue a ''comprehensive report.'' Overriding Poland's objections that it was the victim of United States ''intimidation,'' the commission voted 19 to 13, with 10 countries abstaining, to express concern at ''reports of widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Poland.'' Third world countries divided 8 to 6 in favor of the resolution, sponsored by Denmark, West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. It cited reports of ''arbitrary arrest and detention of thousands of persons'' and the denial of rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and the right to form and join independent trade unions. It called for ''release of all persons detained without charges'' and ''the lifting of restrictions on the free flow of information.'' Warsaw announced the release of 3,024 people detained under martial law, leaving 3,601 still in ''isolation centers.'' Yesterday, Soviet and East German troops joined in maneuvers in Poland for the first time since December - purportedly a sign the country was returning to conditions Moscow considers normal."
