"Amnesty International said today that well over 1,000 people were being killed each month in a tide of political violence sweeping across Sri Lanka. Reports of killings in the south by security forces, vigilante death squads and left-wing rebels increased dramatically since a state of emergency decree was reimposed last June, the London-based human-rights group said. Amnesty said the violent tactics of the left-wing Sinhalese guerrillas, the People's Liberation Front, had been increasingly mirrored by the armed forces, the police and pro-Government paramilitary groups. ''Violence is so widespread that it is often difficult to establish with certainty who the agents of specific killings were,'' Amnesty said in a report. Government Promises Inquiry Both sides displayed the bodies, severed heads and limbs of their victims to instill terror, the report said. ''The bodies of the victims, often mutilated, are burnt on rubber tires by the roadside, dumped in cemeteries or thrown in rivers to float out to sea,'' the report said. ''By September 1989, well over 1,000 people were estimated to be killed each month in the conflict, with daily reports of reprisal killings attributed to the official or semi-official security forces becoming commonplace,'' Amnesty said. The Sri Lankan Government says the paramilitary groups operate outside the law. It has promised to investigate allegations of military involvement in vigilante killings. Amnesty said police or military spokesmen often blamed illegal paramilitary gangs for killings carried out by Government forces or condoned by the Government. ''Police spokesmen in several cases made prompt public statements attributing specific killings to the hitherto unknown 'Black Cats' or 'Eagles of the Central Hills' even before inquiries could have been conducted into the incidents,'' it said."
