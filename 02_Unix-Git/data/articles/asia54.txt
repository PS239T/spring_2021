"  HUMAN RIGHTS IN POST-MAO CHINA. By John F. Copper, Franz Michael and Yuan-li Wu. (Westview, Paper, $15.) When the Cultural Revolution ended with Mao Zedong's death in 1976, the new Chinese leadership began a modernization drive that has opened up a xenophobic nation to the West and introduced free markets into a backward economy. China's political system, ''a Soviet-style communist leadership and policy-making organization,'' the authors call it, remains intact however, and human rights are caught between the ''regime's need to modernize and hold on to the tools of total power.'' While the authors, all of whom are academics in the United States, admit to a Western bias, their narrow, theoretical world view, in which everything is perceived in terms of total conflict between Communism and the West, blinds them to Chinese realities. For example, they attack China's coercive birth-control policies but fail to discuss alternatives for so populous a country. ''Human Rights in Post-Mao China,'' which contains much technical writing, documents the trial of a politi-cal dissident and provides an analysis of human rights in China from a historical perspective. Communism is described as a system imposed on a nation with a humanist tradition; human rights abuses under imperial rule and the Chinese Nationalists, however, are ignored. The book focuses on the conflict between China's importing Western technology and management skills while attempting to prevent the infiltration of Western ideas. And this raises an important question: What impact will modernization have on China's political system and human rights there?"
