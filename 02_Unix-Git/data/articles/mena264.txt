"To the Editor: A news item May 11 on protests in Cairo against the death in detention this month of Abdel Harith Madani, a 32-year-old Cairo defense lawyer, quotes a spokesman for the Egyptian Interior Ministry: "" 'What do you expect the Government to say? He died God's death,' the spokesman said. 'We never violate human rights.' "" This response is disgraceful. Mr. Madani, a member of the internationally respected Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, was arrested April 26 at his law office, blindfolded and taken to an unknown site. Ten days later, the police notified his family that he was dead. According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, Mr. Madani -- who was in good health -- had been moved to a prison cell in a Cairo hospital two days after his arrest, suggesting that he may have sustained injuries in the first days of custody that required medical treatment. In addition, Mr. Madani's body was examined by a coroner and prepared for burial three days before the police notified his family of his death. The record on incommunicado detention and torture in Egypt has been well-documented for years by human rights organizations and discussed with Egyptian officials at the highest levels of government. The accumulated evidence of torture includes scores, if not hundreds, of forensic medical reports prepared by government-employed physicians who have examined torture victims. Torture has worsened in Egypt, with 14 deaths in detention last year alone. If the Egyptian Government is truly committed to the rule of law and respect for human rights, as it claims, it must take action to investigate Mr. Madani's death immediately. Those found responsible should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. VIRGINIA N. SHERRY  Associate Director  Human Rights Watch/Middle East  New York, May 11, 1994"
