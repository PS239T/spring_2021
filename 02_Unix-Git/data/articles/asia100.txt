"The Indian Government has denounced as ''one-sided and distorted'' a report by Amnesty International that said scores of people had been killed illegally by security forces in Punjab state and elsewhere. A Government spokesman said today that the report by the international human rights group, issued Tuesday, had focused on ''stray incidents of human rights, but minimized the numerous rights and freedoms enjoyed by Indian nationals and the independence of the press.'' The spokesman added that investigations of most specific charges of human rights violations had shown that they were baseless. ''Wherever charges were proved, exemplary action was taken against the guilty,'' he said. He did not refer to specific incidents mentioned in the Amnesty report, which cited evidence that the police in Punjab staged ''encounters'' in which Sikh militants were slain. It said that other such slayings had been reported in at least three other states. The review also included an appendix on reports that Indian troops in Sri Lanka had tortured and killed Tamils there. The troops were sent to Sri Lanka to enforce a peace accord and have been fighting Tamil separatists."
