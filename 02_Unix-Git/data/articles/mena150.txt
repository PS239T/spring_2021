"United States aid has been meager: about $50 million a year. This is a pittance for the friendship, patience and loyalty King Hussein has shown over the years. Since 1973, he has maintained de facto peace and tacit cooperation with Israel, and issued a number of peace proposals. More important, he has implemented political reforms at home, making Jordan the most democratic of the Arab states. ''Jordan: Human Rights Protection After the State of Emergency,'' an Amnesty International report of last June, documents the brutal political repression that once characterized life in Jordan. Recent changes, while not revolutionary, are unprecedented. Scores of political prisoners and detainees have been released, instruments of repression reined in, and freedom of expression restored. Last November, the country elected its first free parliament in 22 years. In the coming months, if security is not threatened by external conflict, martial law will be completely abolished and political parties legalized. Israel's supporters often say it is the only democracy in the Middle East and chastise the Arab states for human rights abuses. President Bush has also made help for ''emerging democracies'' a priority. If both place such importance on democratic development, then increased foreign aid should be immediate. This is especially true if the United States insists on making its blockade of Iraq absolute. It is unlikely that President Bush will grant Jordan even partial exemption, despite its economic situation and highly politicized Palestinian population. At the least, Jordan should be compensated for losses; otherwise, its nascent democratic experiment and King will flounder.
