"To the Editor: Hal Wyner stresses the responsibility of journalists - Jewish as well as non-Jewish - to cover events in Israel and the territories honestly and truthfully, as they see them, without denying or minimizing human rights abuses and questions (Op-Ed, Oct. 8). Regrettably, one part of the picture that has rarely been brought to light in the North American news media involves the precious glimmers of hope represented by those Israelis, both Jews and Arabs, who are working hard to further civil rights and civil liberties, to strengthen democracy in the midst of an extremely polarized and violent situation. One such organization, which our foundation is proud to support, is the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. It is Israel's foremost civil liberties organization, active in such areas as discrimination against minorities, freedom of expression, religious coercion and women's rights. Lately, the Association for Civil Rights has been in Israel's headlines almost every week because of its involvement in human rights issues pertaining to the territories, such as administrative detention, deportation orders, house demolitions, prison conditions and illegal use of violence by the armed forces. The New Israel Fund, which is a philanthropy jointly organized and run by Israelis, Americans and Canadians, provides support to a broad range of nonprofit groups in Israel, promoting civil rights and liberties, and fostering pluralism, coexistence and social equality. These efforts are under way within Israel itself, building the kind of vibrant democracy that the nation's founders envisioned. That is the kind of Israel, after all, we're determined to see when all of the broader polit-ical problems are ultimately solved.
