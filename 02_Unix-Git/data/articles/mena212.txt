"President Hashemi Rafsanjani, reputedly a pragmatist, seems to have prevailed in Iran's parliamentary elections. Official results give his party a commanding lead. But before the vote, a Council of Guardians disqualified dozens of hostile candidates as spiritually incorrect. And though the Government claimed a massive turnout, foreign reporters saw few lines at polling booths. Even so, Westerners can hope that Mr. Rafsanjani, newly strengthened, will now end Iran's human rights abuses at home and its terrorism abroad. Experience cautions against undue optimism. Last month, for the first time in four years, a leader of the Bahai faith was secretly executed. This coincided with the expulsion of all foreign Red Cross workers for allegedly helping United Nations monitors expose the torture of political prisoners. Still standing is Ayatollah Khomeini's infamous decree calling for the murder of the novelist Salman Rushdie. Iranian Revolutionary Guards have flocked to the Sudan, adding to the fury of an Islamic holy war. In an election-eve show of force, Iranian warplanes raided Iraq in an abortive strike against the People's Mujahedeen, an armed opposition group. Mr. Rafsanjani's advocates complain that Westerners are insufficiently grateful for Iran's help in freeing the hostages held so long in Lebanon.  But Iran's gesture owed less to humanitarianism than hard calculation. The hostages were an obstacle to urgently needed Western trade. Even so, President Bush, having promised in 1989 that good will would beget good will, could honor his words by sending a note recognizing Mr. Refsanjani's election. He might also make clear, however, that greater reciprocity depends on Iran's willingness to honor international norms of sovereignty and human rights."
