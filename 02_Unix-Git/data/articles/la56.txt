"Argentina's first nationwide general strike in six and a half years of military rule closed factories, public transportation and shops today as nine million workers defied the Government to protest inflation and reported human rights abuses. President Reynaldo B. Bignone held an emergency meeting with the social welfare and social security ministers in the late afternoon in an attempt to draft emergency salary measures. Labor leaders and Government officials said at least 90 percent of the country's 10 million workers stayed home in the 24-hour strike despite a Government ban on work stoppages. The military junta made no move to break the strike, which ended at midnight. Unions are also pressing the Government to pay unemployment benefits to the 18 percent of the population that is out of work in the country's worst economic crisis this century."
