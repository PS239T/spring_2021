"Pro-democracy forces claimed a huge lead in the initial vote-counting early today in Malawi's referendum on one-party rule. The opposition party, the United Democratic Front, which is hoping to oust President H. Kamuzu Banda, said that with about one-third of all votes counted, the pro-democracy parties had 89 percent and the ruling Malawi Congress Party had 11 percent. Independent analysts cautioned that the figures came mainly from urban areas, where the United Democratic Party and its ally, the Alliance for Democracy, were strongest. Returns from rural regions, where voters are more conservative, are likely to reduce the opposition's lead. Indeed, United Democratic monitors said unofficial figures showed the Malawi Congress Party leading 71 percent to 29 percent in the central region. Monitors from the European Community complained of serious intimidation by the ruling party during the campaign. The Malawi Congress Party denied any wrongdoing and said its supporters had been harassed. Dr. Banda, 87, was forced into the referendum after most donor nations halted aid to Malawi after reports of human rights abuses."
