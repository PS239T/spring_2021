"The Argentine Government has formally protested the publication last week of a Carter Administration report accusing Argentina of human rights violations. The United States Ambassador, Harry Schlaudeman, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry last night and handed a formal note of protest describing the report as ''a violation of the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other nations,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. Although the Carter Administration's final report on worldwide human rights issues accused Argentina of violations, it said that far fewer people had been kidnaped by security forces over the past year than during the first two years of rule by the present military government. Nonetheless, the report listed 28 disappearances in 1980 and said most observers believed torture and summary executions were still common."
