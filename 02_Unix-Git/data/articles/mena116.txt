"To the Editor: Actions by the Israeli Government against the Arab people give rise to yet another look at the credibility of our foreign policy. We deny the Soviet Union Class A trade status because of its ''denial of human rights''; Poland is denied World Bank credit because of its ''denial of human rights.'' Cuba is embargoed because it ''denies human rights.'' We arm Nicaraguan contras because the Sandinista Government ''denies human rights.'' We castigate North Korea and won't recognize Vietnam for the same reason. Yet, although it is not the only example, we support the Likud Government of Israel with money, arms, supplies and our emotions despite our now having to concede it ''denies human rights.'' We should urge that our policy at least be consistent. DON SLOAN New York, Feb. 4, 1988"
