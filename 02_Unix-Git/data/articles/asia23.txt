"To the Editor: It was encouraging to read (news story March 29) of an instance where the U.S. will engage in quiet diplomacy on human-rights issues - par-ticularly with regard to the Republic of Korea, where many national security interests compete. What was discouraging, however, was to read in the same article about the Ad-ministration's ready acceptance of progress in the Korean human-rights situation, and particularly on the grounds cited.  or example, the U.S. found ''encouraging'' the fact that the U.N.  Commission on Human Rights recently removed the Republic of Korea from the list of those engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. Last July, when the U.S. wanted to approve loans to Paraguay, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay - all countries then on the U.N.  commission's list -no notice was taken of the commission's pronouncements. But then, to accept the U.N.'s judgment in that instance would have triggered the prohibition against U.S. approval for loans to gross human-rights violators under the International Financial Institutions Act. The second fact the U.S. found encouraging was the amnesty recently proclaimed by President Chun Doo Hwan. Unfortunately, this year the U.N. Commission was fooled by the strategically timed amnesty as much as the U.S. appears to have been. The ''amnesty,'' it now turns out, was mostly for common criminals. In fact, only 15 political prisoners were actually released - hardly a ''move in the right direction'' to warrant satisfaction by the U.N., the U.S. or the 400 political prisoners remaining in prison.
