"Amnesty International charged Mauritania's military rulers today with torturing prisoners suspected of political opposition. The London-based human rights organization said people imprisoned in the West African country under harsh conditions included former government officials, journalists and others arrested in March 1982. In a press statement, Amnesty said it had received reports that most of those arrested as political suspects were tortured by such methods as beating, being stripped, hung upside down by their feet and burned with hot coals. It said it had details of 23 cases but believed that political arrests since 1979 numbered about 100."
