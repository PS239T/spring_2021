"The Supreme Court ruled tonight that civilian judges can try nine former leaders of the armed forces who are accused of violating human rights during Argentina's years of military rule. The high court said the three-man Federal Court of Appeals acted properly in deciding to take control of the cases from a military tribunal that had failed to act in nine months. It rejected defendants' arguments that jurisdiction should be returned to the tribunal. The ruling clears the way for public trials before the appeals court that local news organizations have likened to the Nuremburg war crimes trials that followed World War II. The defendants are accused of involvement in the abduction, torture and disappearance of at least 9,000 people during a campaign by security forces against leftists in the late 1970's. On trial are the generals and admirals who made up three successive three-man juntas that ruled after a coup in 1976. They are Jorge Rafael Videla, Roberto Eduardo Viola and Leopoldo Galtieri, who were Presidents and Army commanders; ; Emilio Massera, Armando Lambruschini and Jorge Anaya, who were Navy commanders, and Orlando Agosti, Omar Graffigna and Basilio Lami Dozo, who commanded the Air Force. President Raul Alfonsin ordered their prosecution three days after his inauguration, on Dec. 10, 1983, ended nearly eight years of dictatorship. He ordered that the summary trials be carried out by the Armed Forces Supreme Council, the country's top military tribunal. But it failed to reach a verdict and, on Oct. 4, the appeals court took charge, ruling that the council was guilty of ''unjustified delays.''"
