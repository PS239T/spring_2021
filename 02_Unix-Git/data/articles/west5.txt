"To the Editor: In his answer to the Rev. Daniel Berrigan's Oct. 9 Op-Ed article, Michael Alison, British Minister of State for Northern Ireland, advanced what would seem to be a reasonable excuse for the refusal to permit the clergyman to visit the prisoners in Long Kesh and Armagh Women's Prison. ''He came without warning and demanded access,'' the Minister explains (letter Oct. 20). We are left with the presumption that, had Father Berrigan given timely notice of his request, the doors of both prisons would have been open to him and he would have been allowed at least a limited opportunity to see conditions within the prison walls. ertain known facts, however, belie that presumption. The truth is that nobody from the outside except the chaplains assigned to the prisons gets inside either institution. The very prestigious Haldane Society sought access three months ago, and was denied. The society is a London-based legal organization, 50 years old and devoted to civil rights everywhere. It had set no time limits in its request for access. The National Executive Committee of the British Labor Party appointed a subcommittee, including two members of Parliament, to investigate conditions in these same prisons. Even the presence of duly elected members of the British Parliament was not enough to gain permission to get inside the prison walls. Notice or time was not an issue. Mr. Alison's statement that ''... the (British) Government is firmly committed to the observance of human rights in Northern Ireland,'' is contradicted by no less an authority than the European Court of Human Rights, which found Great Britain guilty of torturing prisoners in Long Kesh. Last year, Amnesty International found that the practice was still continuing. It is regrettable that both Father Berrigan's opus and Minister Alison's reply ignored the more basic question of why Great Britain continues to occupy part of Ireland.  PAUL O'DWYER New York, Oct. 31, 1980"
