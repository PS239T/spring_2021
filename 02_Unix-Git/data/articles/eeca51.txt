"To the Editor:  On June 27, you reported that four Soviet Nobel Prize winners had signed an appeal to President Reagan on behalf of Leonard Peltier, an American Indian activist, sentenced to two consecutive life terms for two murders, who recently staged a hunger strike in Federal prison because he was not allowed to worship with other American Indians and to keep a sacred pipe, drum and eagle feathers in his cell. No matter what motivated the Nobel laureates to urge President Reagan to ''stop the violation of human rights in your own country . . . where your compatriot . . . is dying,'' such protest should be welcomed. It will show the Soviets that, contrary to their practice, their appeal is being printed freely in the country at which it is directed. It will also show them that neither Mr. Peltier's physical condition, nor his fate, nor his whereabouts are hidden from public knowledge (which, sadly, is not the case with Andrei Sakharov and his wife, Yelena Bonner, or of other dissidents in the Soviet Union).  Finally, what pleases me about the the Nobel laureates' action is that it affirms what people concerned with civil rights have felt all along: there is no such thing as interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country when it comes to basic rights of human beings. The community of mankind has no problems with this premise, and neither should governments.  The Soviet Nobel laureates have practically told their Government that, welcome or not, criticism over human rights has an important, legitimate place in relations between nations. FRANK REISS New York, July 2, 1984"
