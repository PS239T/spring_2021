"A senior official of Kenya's sole political party was quoted today as saying the party might soon begin censoring foreign journalists' reports. The Daily Nation, a mass-circulation paper, quoted the national organizing secretary of the Kenya African National Union, Laban Kitele, as saying that the party had lost patience with foreign journalists for their ''smear campaign against the country.'' Mr. Kitele reportedly criticized reports in the Western press of human-rights abuses by the Government and articles on AIDS in Kenya."
