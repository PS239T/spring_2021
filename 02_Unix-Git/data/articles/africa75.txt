"To the Editor: Reading the interview with Ethiopia's dictator, Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam (front page, Nov. 28), I scarcely recognized the man who has been diligently slaughtering his own people, as reported by every major news organization, including yours. Colonel Mengistu's longing for rapprochement is hardly surprising, now that his country is in a shambles. On seizing power he slavishly applied classic Marxist-Leninist dogma and drove the economy into the ground. Facing the inevitable popular uprising, he embarked on a savage war of repression against those seeking survival and freedom. Failing to snuff out Ethiopian cries of anger, he turned to genocide by starvation, uprooting the farmers and seizing most of the food and relief supplies sent by the United States and others, diverting some to his army and leaving the rest to rot in his government warehouses. A group of us in Congress has followed this tragedy with growing sorrow and outrage. Last summer, we won enactment of economic sanctions against the Mengistu regime. For us, the only acceptable United States policy is to demand President Mengistu's removal. He is a mass murderer, who intends to repeat in Africa the horror perpetrated by Pol Pot on the Cambodian people, and we have a moral duty to prevent it. No public relations campaign can cover up Colonel Mengistu's crimes against the Ethiopian people. Let no one be fooled; this ploy to win redemption will only be used to prolong Ethiopia's agony. TOBY ROTH Member of Congress, 8th Dist., Wis.   Washington, Nov. 28, 1988"
