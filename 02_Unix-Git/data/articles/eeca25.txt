"To the Editor: Public attention to foreign affairs is often short-lived. There is great danger that we might tire of the Polish crisis and turn to other international matters. But serious human-rights violations persist in Poland, and we must keep American public opinion focused on them. he nature of repression in Poland is illustrated by the plight of certain individuals now in detention. One poignant example is the case of Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, a Catholic who has twice been honored by Israel for his role in saving Jews in Poland from the Nazi Holocaust. Since then, he has been prominently identified with human-rights causes both in Poland and around the world. His continued detention calls out for strong public protest. We call for his immediate release. My experience in the past year as co-chairman of the Polish-Jewish Task Force, sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and several Polish groups, indicates that Americans will support a program advocating human rights in Poland, private relief efforts for the Polish people, an international response to Polish refugees and assurance that the manifestations in the early days of the military crackdown of officially sanctioned anti-Semitism do not recur. We must remain vigilant in support of these objectives.  GEORGE M. SZABAD New York, March 17, 1982"
