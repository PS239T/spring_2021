"The American Ambassador to China, James Lilley, said on Sunday that he regrets calling demonstrators against Chinese human-rights abuses ""cowards"" and suggesting that one man, a Tibetan, ""go back to China and serve China."" Mr. Lilley said the protesters had provoked him with an obscene name. ""It was a mistake,"" Mr. Lilley said of the incident on Saturday before he addressed a Chinese-American trade conference. ""I shouldn't have done it."" He defended his position on human rights in China, noting that he had negotiated the passage to exile of an important Chinese dissident, Fang Lizhi."
