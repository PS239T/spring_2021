"Amnesty International said today that more than 1,000 political prisoners had been shot or hanged in Iran over the past six months in the biggest wave of executions there since the early 1980's. In a statement to the United Nations' annual review of human rights abuses, Amnesty International said the victims were mostly supporters of the People's Mujahedeen opposition group, but included members of other left-wing groups. ''Among them were a large number of prisoners of conscience and others serving prison terms, imposed after unfair trials, for their nonviolent political activity,'' the London-based human rights group said. ''The wave of executions began last August and has been the biggest in Iran since thousands of political prisoners were put to death in the early 1980's,'' it added. Amnesty also told the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, opening its annual session in Geneva today, that it had evidence of other violations including torture, detention without trial, unfair trials and ''cruel, inhuman or degrading'' punishment such as the cutting off of thieves' fingers."
