"Zimbabwean policemen today arrested the leaders of the country's top human rights group, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, a move that is expected to further strain relations between Zimbabwe and its Western aid donors, the United States and Britain. The commission's chairman, Michael Auret, and its acting director, Nicholas Ndebele, were arrested for possession of prohibited documents and the police seized some papers from the commission office, according to commission personnel. The documents are believed to be reports about the use of torture and other human rights abuses in the country. The two are understood to be held under Zimbabwe's sweeping emergency powers, which permit indefinite detention without trial. Mr. Ndebele was arrested May 22, and the High Court ordered his release Wednesday. The Home Affairs Minister, Enos Nkala, apparently overruled the court decision by ordering the rearrest of Mr. Ndebele and the arrest of Mr. Auret."
