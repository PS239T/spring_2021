"  Palestinian police officers have raided the office of a human rights activist who is a leading critic of Yasir Arafat, and the Palestinian attorney general said today that drugs had been found in the search.  Dr. Eyad R. Sarraj was arrested on Sunday. He was arrested last month after criticizing Mr. Arafat's government, but was released nine days later after an international outcry. An attorney for Dr. Sarraj said he believed the drugs were planted to justify keeping Dr. Sarraj in jail."
