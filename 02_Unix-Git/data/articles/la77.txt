"A new report by the International League for Human Rights asserts that there has been a deterioration of human rights in Paraguay over the last two years. After 28 years of military rule under Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the Paraguayan Government ''continues to invoke martial law as the justification for arbitrary actions such as preventive arrests, detention without charge and unreasonable delay before trial,'' the report by the private organization said. The latest League report was a follow-up on one two years ago that also criticized human rights violations in Paraguay."
