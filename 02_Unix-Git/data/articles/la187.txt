"A right-wing death squad threatened today to kill journalists who ''collaborate'' with leftist Salvadoran guerrillas. The threat came in a communique from the Salvadoran Anti-Communist Commando, published in the conservative daily Diario de Hoy. ''We inform radio, television and newspaper journalists who collaborate with the enemies of our republic that they will be executed,'' the communique said. It accused journalists of distorting news and charged that many reporters were in the pay of international Communist movements. The group has also signed death threats sent to leading Salvadoran churchmen who have spoken out against human rights abuses."
