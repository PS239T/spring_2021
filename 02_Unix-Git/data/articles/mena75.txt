"Israeli Justice Ministry officials said today that they were investigating charges by Amnesty International that Israeli security forces had tortured Palestinian prisoners. The report prepared by the international human-rights organization said Arab prisoners held in the West Bank and in a prison in southern Lebanon had been tortured. ''We have had excellent relations with Amnesty over the years, and each complaint we get is investigated in the most detailed manner,'' a Justice Ministry spokesman said."
