"Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that he would talk only about the South Korean airliner and Soviet human rights violations during his scheduled meeting with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko on Thursday. Speaking with reporters aboard his Air Force place that flew him here, Mr. Shultz said he regarded the session with Mr. Gromyko as an opportunity ''to confront directly a member of the Politburo'' and to ''put it to their high authorities directly - why don't they tell the truth?'' Mr. Shultz arrived early today for a three-day meeting of 35 foreign ministers who are gathering to sign a document on further steps in East-West cooperation that has been under negotiation for three years. The United States agreed to the document in July. Mr. Shultz had originally planned a working luncheon with Mr. Gromyko to discuss the whole range of Soviet- American issues, with additional sessions in New York later this month when the two men attend the United Nations General Assembly session. But today Mr. Shultz said he had not decided whether to hold the meeting in New York. He said this would depend on the outcome of the session here. ''My agenda for the meeting with Foreign Minister Gromyko will be strictly human rights matters and, in particular, the shooting down of the Korean airliner,'' he said. When asked why he was being so restrictive, Mr. Shultz said: ''This meeting in Madrid has its whole center of gravity on the subject of human rights. That's what this is all about. And that's what deserves the emphasis.'' Mr. Shultz will confer with other Atlantic alliance foreign ministers about actions that may be taken, especially in civil aviation, in response to the airliner incident. Mr. Gromyko is to address the Madrid conference today, and Mr. Shultz will speak Friday."
