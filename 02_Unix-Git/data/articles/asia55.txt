"The Vietnamese-backed Cambodian Government offered today to start negotiations with Bangkok to solve the problem of Cambodian refugees in Thailand. The official Cambodian press agency said in a report monitored in Bangkok that Phnom Penh was ready to enter discussions. The Thai National Security Council chief, Prasong Soonsiri, said last week that Thailand would soon send 230,000 to 240,000 refugees now in Thai camps back to border camps in Cambodia. The Cambodian press agency demanded an immediate halt to any plans for Thai repatriation of Cambodians and said such a move would be ''barbarous, inhuman, criminal and a grave violation of human rights.'' There was no comment by Thailand on the Cambodian offer."
