"Nicaragua's human rights record has come under sharp questioning here by a committee of United Nations' experts. As a result, the Nicaraguan Minister of Justice, Carlos Arguello, has been asked to return on Monday to reply to a series of charges.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee said it would like him to explain the forced relocation of an estimated 14,500 Miskito Indians and the what it said was the arrest and execution of some; the purported abuse of Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy and the reported flight of Nicaragua's small Jewish population; curbs on the press, judiciary and political parties, and the purported use of torture. All these points were raised this week in the Human Rights Committee, a group of 18 lawyers, academics and other specialists who monitor the United Nations' covenants on human rights. Unlike the United Nations Human Rights Commission, members of the committee do not represent governments and so can deliver far more candid and searching reports. There is no American on the committee, however, because the United States has never ratified the human rights treaties. Mr. Arguello appeared before the committee this week with Nicaragua's latest report on rights. It affirms that the Sandinist regime gives ''priority to the promotion, protection and substantial expansion of human rights.'' But, Mr. Arguello said, ''acts of aggression carried out by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,'' a reference to the insurgents Nicaragua is fighting, had forced his country to declare a state of emergency and suspend legal rights ''for the purpose of self-defense.'' Many Reported to Flee About half of the Miskito Indian population is reported to have fled to Honduras and the rest have been forced to move from their ancestral homes near the border. Mr. Arguello's report said the Indians had been pushed out because their territory was ''the scene of subversive actions aimed at destabilizing'' the Sandinist revolution."
