"The European Court of Human Rights today found the British Government guilty of sex discrimination in immigration laws that permit men who are legally settled to bring their wives to Britain but do not permit women residents to bring their husbands. The ruling could affect as many as 2,000 couples a year, according to the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which helped to bring the case before the court in Strasbourg, France. A spokesman for the British Government said today that it would abide by the court's decision."
