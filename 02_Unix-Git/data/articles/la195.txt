"The head of a presidential commission investigating human rights abuses says that about 700 people were buried in a mass grave after being tortured and shot by officials of the former military dictatorship. Ernesto Sabato, president of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, said exhumation of the grave, reported to be at Cordoba's San Vicente Cemetery, would begin in a few days. If the report is accurate, it would be the largest mass grave discovered in Argentina since human rights groups began denouncing the secret burial of victims of repression in late 1982. Thousands of people disappeared in the military Government's campaign against leftist guerrillas in the mid-1970's. Mr. Sabato, who spoke to reporters on Friday in Cordoba, 480 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, said the commission obtained a Cordoba city morgue ledger listing about 700 of the people whose bodies passed through the morgue in the years after the military came to power in a coup in 1976. He said the book detailed the conditions of the bodies received - ''that is to say, the tortures and torments and bullet holes from firing squads.''"
