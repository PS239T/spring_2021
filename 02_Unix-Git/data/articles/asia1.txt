"Two natives of India have won private settlements from employers after they complained to the New York City Human Rights Commission that they were discriminated against because of their national origin, the commission said yesterday. One complainant, Indravadan P. Shah of Forest Hills, Queens, won $11,500 in damages, while the other, Kailish Sharma of White Plains, earned an offer of the first available position, the commission said. Mr. Shah charged Me rrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith with violating the Human Rights Law when it denied him a promotion and appointed a w hite American with less seniority and experience in his place. Mr. Sh ah, who earned $25,000 a year as a senior marketing analyst, said he was discharged about two months after he inquired about his los t promotion. Mrs. Sharma, a registered nurse, filed her complaint against the Westchester County Medical Center's Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla.  She alleged that although she had three years of operat ing-room experience and had passed a medical exam, the hospital had denied herjob application in favor of others. Under the terms of the two settlements, neither of the employers admitted to any discrimination or violation of the Human Rights Law."
