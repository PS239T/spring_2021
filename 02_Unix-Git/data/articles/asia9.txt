"Ernest Lefever, the Reagan Administration's choice for Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, has condemned ''public preaching to friend or foe.'' But whether he likes it or not, Congress has directed the office he is to head to assess foreign countries' records on rights. Its report, published last week, was the last by the Carter Administration, which believed public criticism could be an effective blunt instrument. On Latin America, the report expressed concern at political violence in Guatemala and at kidnappings and murders in El Salvador by leftist guerrillas, ''death squads and other rightist terrorist groups which include present or retired members of the military.'' In Bolivia, the report said, the military regime that seized power in July ''destroyed the favorable human rights climate.'' Argentina and Chile were credited with sharp reductions in disappearances of persons under arrest, but they, like other countries under permanent military rule, made little progress ''toward respect for political and civil freedoms.'' Soviet troops in Afghanistan were assailed for ''reported use of lethal chemical weapons, 'trick' explosives and indiscriminate bombing.'' Inside Russia, the survey said, repression last year was ''as severe as any since the beginning of the (dissident) human rights movement over a decade ago.'' At the Administration's request, Congress delayed publishing the report to avoid red faces during the visit of President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea. The survey said that in his country, ''after some improvement in the earlier part of the year, the observance of civil and political rights was marked by deterioration.''"
