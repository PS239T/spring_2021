"China dismissed as ''groundless'' today a report by the human rights group Amnesty International that criticized what it said were widespread executions and human rights violations in China. ''It is groundless for Amnesty International to accuse China of violating human rights,'' said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Yuzhen. Mr. Ma said the London-based human rights group, which called on Peking to abolish the death penalty, was wrongly applying Western legal norms to China."
