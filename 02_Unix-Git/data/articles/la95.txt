"A former major arrested in connection with the kidnapping of a wealthy landowner is believed to have headed ''death squads'' totaling about 400 members, the police said today. The Salvadoran Government, apparently trying to show that it is making progress in human rights, as President Reagan asserted Thursday, also announced it had uncovered a multimillion-dollar fraud plot in its agrarian program. Guillermo Bustamante, a member of one of El Salvador's wealthiest families, was kidnapped two weeks ago and freed Thursday night in a special forces operation, a police source said. $4 Million Ransom Demanded The source, who requested anonymity, said former Maj. Guillermo Roeder Escobar was arrested when he went to pick up the more than $4 million ransom that the kidnappers had demanded. ''Many things will come out during the investigation, among them kidnappings and assassinations,'' the source said.  ''We believe that he had control of some 400 men who acted as death squads,'' said a high police official, who also asked not to be identified. The police source said Major Roeder organized groups of armed men to give ''protection'' to domestic and foreign businesses.  Church and human rights groups have charged that the Government has links to paramilitary, right-wing death squads blamed for thousands of deaths in the two years of civil strife in El Salvador. The Government disclaims responsibility for the squads."
