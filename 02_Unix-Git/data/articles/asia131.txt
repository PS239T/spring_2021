"To the Editor: Two human-rights reports describe beatings, torture and killings of Tamil-speaking civilians by Indian peacekeeping troops in Sri Lanka (news story, May 17). Indian security forces are practicing the same kind of torture, and worse, against Sikhs in the Punjab region of India. The Committee for Information and Initiative on Punjab, an Indian human rights group based in New Delhi and administered by Hindus, not Sikhs, has recently released ''State Terrorism in the Punjab'' and a second study on the the sadistic practices of the senior superintendent of police in Batala village. These studies describe recurrent cases of torture by beatings, by electric shock to the genitals, by suspending victims from the ceiling while beating them, rolling heavy logs over the legs of women till muscles rupture, stuffing irritating agents like chili up the anus. There are unrelenting cases of ''armed encounters,'' staged by Indian police and security forces to cover up murders of young Sikh men - some who died during torture, some shot, unarmed, in the street, most killed in secluded areas. Amnesty International, banned from the Punjab by Rajiv Gandhi, has reported on these faked encounters, leaked to them by human rights sources in the Punjab and too numerous to be discounted. There have been many cases of rape and sexual humiliation of Sikh women, some as young as 10 years old, reported by the Committee for Information and Initiative. The Chandigarh Tribune in Punjab reported on May 1 the torture and abuse of two Sikh sisters, 18 and 21 years old, as well as their mother, by local police in Batala. Torture of the Sikh population by Indian police and security forces is more severe than the torture you report in Sri Lanka and has occurred since 1984. We urge you to report on it.
