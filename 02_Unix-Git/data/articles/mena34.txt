"The security forces of the Syrian Government are increasingly violating human rights by detaining people without trial and harassing, torturing and sometimes killing them, according to an Amnesty International report released yesterday. In the report, the London-based human rights group said that since 1963, when the country entered a state of emergency that is still in effect, Government security forces have expanded their power so that today ''anyone is liable to arbitrary arrest or abduction and no one can depend on the protection of law.'' The report cites numerous abuses, including arrest and detention of people without charge or trial for years; the ''disappearance'' of political suspects; the holding of relatives of political suspects as hostages for months and years; the torture of political suspects and their relatives; and the mass killing of hundreds of suspected foes of the Assad regime. In the late 1950's, according to the report, there were only two security forces in Syria, while today there are at least eight, all of which are are apparently answerable only to President Hafez al-Assad. 3,500 Arrests Cited Between January 1980 and December 1981, the report says, at least 3,500 people were arrested by Syrian security forces, most of them without a warrant or other authorization of arrest. The detention period before trial often lasts months or years, according the human rights organization, which says it is currently trying to free 17 people who have been detained for more than 12 years without trials."
