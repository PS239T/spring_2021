"Ever since May 13, when Klaus Barbie walked out on his trial in Lyons, France, for crimes against humanity during World War II, his accusers have demanded the chance to confront the onetime Gestapo official in court. Last week, four veterans of the wartime French Resistance got their wish. On orders from Judge Andre Cerdini, the 73-year-old former Nazi was forced to return to be identified by people who say he subjected them to beatings with a whip and chain, hanging by the hands, and near-drownings. ''That is the man,'' said Raymonde Guyon, a Roman Catholic doctor who ran a Resistance newspaper and who helped smuggle Jews out of France, after the country fell to the Nazis. ''It was he who interrogated me, tortured me. It was he who told me my husband would be shot - and he was.'' Mr. Barbie, who denies he was linked to the Nazi campaign of genocide against Jews, read a short statement reiterating that he had been kidnapped illegally in Bolivia four years ago and protesting his trial. Next day, resuming his boycott of the proceedings, as permitted by French law, Mr. Barbie was absent when witnesses accused him of responsibility for the arrest of 44 Jewish children at a farmhouse near Lyons. Jacques Favet, a retired farm laborer, said he had seen Mr. Barbie at the scene where the children were kicked and thrown ''like sacks of potatoes'' into trucks, which took them away for deportation to the gas chambers of Auschwitz."
