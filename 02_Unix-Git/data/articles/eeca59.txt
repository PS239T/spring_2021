"To the Editor: I was encouraged to read that the new Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, is a man noted among diplomats for his ''affability and charm'' (news article, July 31). As First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, this affable and charming gentleman presided over a ruthless crackdown on Georgian nationalists struggling for the survival of the language, culture and traditions of the ethnic group to which Mr. Shevardnadze himself belongs. One victim of this crackdown, Zakhary K. Lashkarashvili, has been adopted by Amnesty International Group 167. He was sentenced in March 1984 to five years' hard labor and two years' internal exile on a charge of ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.'' His crime was distributing leaflets protesting the Government's plans to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Treaty of Georgievsk, which led to the annexation of Georgia by Czarist Russia. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Helsinki accords, Amnesty International Group 167 has sent Mr. Shevardnadze a petition, signed by 2,611 people from all over the United States, which asks for Mr. Lashkarashvili's immediate release. His punishment is a violation of the Soviet Union's human-rights obligations, not only under the Helsinki accords, but also under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and under the Soviet Constitution itself. It is also in contradiction of Mr. Shevardnadze's assertion, which you quote, that the Soviet Union guarantees ''the full exercise of economic, political, social and cultural rights and individual freedom of citizens.'' Now we are hopeful that our petition to Mr. Shevardnadze will meet with an affable and charming response. ERIC BLITZ New York, Aug. 1, 1985 The writer is Soviet case coordinator for Amnesty International's Adoption Group 167."
