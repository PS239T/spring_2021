"About 60 people in a group marking United Nations Human Rights Day with a silent vigil in downtown Moscow were arrested on Friday, witnesses said. Western correspondents who saw the roundup said several people were detained after removing their hats in a traditional Soviet sign of protest against human rights violations. But most of those arrested were just standing at the base of the statue to Pushkin, the witnesses said. No violence was reported."
