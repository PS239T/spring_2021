"About 20 people took Brazil's Ambassador and seven other people hostage in the embassy here today in a protest against what they said was repression by Guatemala's military Government. One hostage was freed for health reasons. The intruders, saying they were armed and ready to die but displaying no weapons, demanded publication of their complaints and freedom to meet with reporters on the street outside the embassy, which is on the fourth floor of a commercial building. The demands were refused. A statement dropped from a window of the embassy said the leftists wanted to detail allegations of ''massacres, torture, rape and burning of crops and ranches'' by Government forces fighting guerrillas. A young man wearing a handkerchief over his face appeared at a window of the embassy and shouted to reporters below that Ambassador Antonio Carlos de Abreu e Silva and the other hostages ''are fine.'' The midday seizure was carried out by three groups calling themselves the January 31 Popular Front, the Committee of Peasant Unity and the Robin Garcia Student Front."
