"To the Editor: ""Listen to All Iranian Voices"" (editorial, Sept. 26) contains a number of factual errors regarding the People's Mujahedeen (Mojahedin-e Khalq) and the Clinton Administration's planned response to the Congressional requirement for a report on this group. First, Congress directed the Administration to prepare a report solely on the People's Mujahedeen, not on ""all Iranian opposition groups."" Therefore, the Department of State would in no way ""ignore"" the People's Mujahedeen in our response to the statute. Second, some facts that you say are ""not in dispute"" are indeed inaccurate. Contrary to your statements, People's Mujahedeen insurgents attack Iran from bases in central and southern Iraq that are controlled by Saddam Hussein. The claims of the People's Mujahedeen that it is a democratic organization are contradicted by the experience of independent Iranian groups that have attempted to work with the People's Mujahedeen. Furthermore, the People's Mujahedeen assertions that it has ""shed its anti-Americanism"" do not stand up under close scrutiny. Finally, it would be a disservice to human rights activists worldwide -- who have condemned Iran's human rights abuses for years with careful documentation -- to award credit to the People's Mujahedeen for that human rights campaign. The Administration's report on the People's Mujahedeen, which is being coordinated by my office, will address these issues and others in detail, drawing heavily on the People's Mujahedeen's own stated views. It is expected to be issued in October. DAVID C. LITT Director, Office of Northern Gulf Affairs, Department of State Washington, Sept. 29, 1994"
