"To the Editor: The whole tenor of "" 'Ethnic Cleansing,' Cypriot Style"" (editorial, Sept. 5) gives the wrong impression that an ""ethnic cleansing"" was started on the Mediterranean island in 1974 and that Turkey was at fault. Isn't it amazing how soon the news media forget? The Cyprus question has a history of more than 28 years. I would like to quote ""Turkish Cypriote Villagers Resist Greek Onslaught,"" your March 21, 1964, report. It was this article that informed the world about the beginning of an ""ethnic cleansing"" perpetrated by the Greek Cypriots against Turkish Cypriots. The same article also informed us how Archbishop Makarios, who had been President of Cyprus from 1959, resisted disclosing any information about the fate of scores of Turkish Cypriots who were seized by the Greek Cypriots. Such massacres and abductions of Turkish Cypriots continued until 1974. Turkey's action in 1974 as a guarantor power under the 1960 treaties stopped this violent campaign and saved Cyprus from being ""cleansed"" of its ethnic Turks. Even today it is the only effective deterrent against renewed Greek Cypriot aggression for another ethnic cleansing by the Greek Cypriots. M. ATA ERIM Chairman, World Turkish Congress New York, Sept. 10, 1992"
