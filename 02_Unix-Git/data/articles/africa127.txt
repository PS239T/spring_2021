"  The presiding judge at the trials of Ethiopia's former Marxist rulers has adjourned the trials to March. The court announced on Friday that the adjournment was necessary to give defense lawyers time to study the charges, which include hundreds of murders over 17 years of military rule. Sixty-six members of the military junta that seized power in a revolution in 1974 are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including the executions of Emperor Haile Selassie and 60 of his closest ministers and members of the aristocracy."
