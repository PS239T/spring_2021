"Kenya's Foreign Minister described as ''scandalous and unfounded'' today criticism by a United States Congressman of this nation's human rights policies. In a statement published in local newspapers, Foreign Minister Elijah Mwangale said the Government was unaware of any attempts by the Kenyan authorities to prevent the Congressman, Representative Howard Wolpe, from meeting with anyone. Mr. Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Africa, said at a news conference Sunday that he was concerned over what he described as a growing trend of human rights abuses in Kenya. He also told reporters that the Kenyan authorities had intimidated people into canceling meetings with his delegation."
