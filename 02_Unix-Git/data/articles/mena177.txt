"To the Editor: Your July 20 editorial criticizing Turkey's human rights record barely touched upon the progress that has been made regarding human rights in Turkey over the last several years. Turkey's representative Government, democratic Parliament, independent judiciary and free press all insure that the principal tenets of human rights are fully implemented. The Turkish Constitution, penal code and governmental policies categorically outlaw the inhumane treatment of detainees and prisoners. Those suspected of such offenses are prosecuted and, if found guilty, subject to severe sentences. A parliamentary Human Rights Commission now oversees human rights practices. Parliament has reformed the country's legal system, abolishing those articles that allegedly restricted freedom of speech and assembly. In April a general amnesty was granted to all prisoners and all death sentences were commuted. The Government has moved to promote the education level of law-enforcement personnel. Courses on human rights are mandatory at police academies. The judiciary is scrupulously independent. Hearings are open to the public. Detainees have access to their attorneys throughout any pre-arraignment detentions. Confessions and testimony taken by police or prosecutors during detention cannot be used in court unless substantiated by other evidence. In becoming party to the European Convention Against Torture, Turkey accepted the role of outside observers in investigating allegations of torture and monitoring detention facilities. Turkey has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and has ratified the U.N. Convention on Torture. The Turkish democratic and secular system is a catalyst for the promotion of human rights in the region. The Turkish Government is determined to continue making progress to this end. AYDIN SAHINBAS Minister-Counselor, Turkish Embassy Washington, July 23, 1991"
