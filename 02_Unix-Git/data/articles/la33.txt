"Two American doctors who were sent to Chile in an effort to investigate instances of terrorism while they were still under way said today that they had found that three physicians in Chile were being detained and brutalized for treating torture victims. Dr. Jonathan Fine of Boston and Dr. James S. Koopman of Ann Arbor, Mich., sent to Chile nine days ago by five health associations, said in a report prepared for the State Department and Congress that human rights violations are becoming more common in Chile. The Chilean doctors are Manuel Almeyda, who provided written medical documentation of torture to church officials, and Pedro Castillo and Patricio Arroya, who cared for hunger strikers. ''The arrest and detention of these three physicians is a serious act of state repression,'' Dr. Fine and Dr. Koopman said in their report. ''The Catholic Church in Chile and the Chilean Committee on Human Rights have both denounced these arrests as a blatant attempt to deter doctors from treating torture victims and to intimidate human rights advocates.'' Dr. Fine, medical director of the North End Community Health Center in Boston, and Dr. Koopman, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, were sent on the inquiry by the American Public Health Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Association of Social Workers, Physicians Forum and the Emergency Committee to Defend Chilean Health Workers."
