"Martial law courts in Kuwait have now condemned 29 people to death -- including 8 more yesterday -- on charges of collaborating with Iraqi occupiers. This week, seven entertainers were given life sentences. One was an Iraqi-born actress whose offenses include singing a song at the unveiling of a portrait of Saddam Hussein. But all these proceedings are marred by the stench of vengeance and the denial of rudimentary safeguards. Living under occupation poses hard and degrading choices for any subject people. Perhaps all defendants were guilty as charged. Yet there is something unseemly about summary justice meted out by rulers who faced no such dilemmas as they sat out the war in comfortable exile. And now the same leaders who sought international support turn a deaf ear to appeals for clemency and fairer trials. The trials violate provisions of Geneva Conventions that apply during war and occupation. Human Rights Watch, an impartial monitoring group, cites these shortcomings: use of confessions obtained by torture, lack of an appeals court, trials in absentia, denial of adequate legal counsel, use of martial law to try crimes like petty theft and prosecution for offenses not specifically forbidden by any law. Not just suspected collaborators are on trial. So is a ruling family, even now contemptuous of world opinion."
