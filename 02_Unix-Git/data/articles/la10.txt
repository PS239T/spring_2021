"The administrator of El Salvador's Human Rights Commission, Ramon Valladares, 33 years old, was assassinated today by unidentified gunmen as he was driving his car, a police spokesman said. The commission has drawn criticism from rightist groups, and several commission members have been threatened for denouncing human rights violations in this Central American nation. Maria Magdalena Henriques, the commission's 30-year-old spokesman, was kidnapped Oct. 5 and her bullet-riddled body was found two days later by the side of a road near here. Sources close to the commission said they believed she was killed by rightist paramilitary groups."
