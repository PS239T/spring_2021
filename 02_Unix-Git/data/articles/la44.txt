"On what is called ''conditional liberty,'' Argentina has wisely released six human rights defenders after days of detention and isolation. Officials of the Reagan Administration say this vindicates their policy of withholding public criticism of such a brazen crackdown. But the evidence suggests quite the reverse: Argentines responded to vehement worldwide protest - including a fervent one by New York's Senator Moynihan, who has never been mistaken for a mushy-headed liberal. Soon after the arrests, Mr. Moynihan made up for the tongue-tied silence of an Administration that had just taken the softest possible line on human rights violations in Argentina and Chile. He warned in the Senate that Argentina was undermining a scheduled visit by its President-designate, Roberto Viola. ''Absent a positive response to the concern that has been expressed in this Chamber and in our nation to the recent arrests,'' he warned, ''the President's visit will be marred by objections in this body and elsewhere.'' The Senator also used the occasion to dispute the views of Ernest Lefever, the Administration's choice to head the State Department human rights bureau. Mr. Lefever, he said, was ''hardly correct'' in asserting that ''we and other states have no legitimate interest in the fortune of liberty elsewhere.'' When he was President Ford's delegate to the United Nations, Mr.  Moynihan made plain his abhorrence of double talk about human rights in the Soviet bloc and among third-world nations. His speech last week was a salutary early warning that the Reagan team's indifference to human rights is an embarrassment even to those who applaud its stern approach to the same nations."
