"Amnesty International today accused Government soldiers in Chad of carrying out hundreds of summary executions and random killings in the past two months. The human-rights group blamed a drive by security policemen and President Hissen Habre's guard against rebels in southern Chad. Amnesty International did not put a figure on the number killed but one official said the most conservative total was ''over 200.'' Chad has long been torn by fighting between forces loyal to President Habre and the rebels, led by former President Goukouni Oueddei. Amnesty said Government troops had executed at least 80 people suspected of armed opposition after they were rounded up in the Longone area Sept. 27. Amnesty also said some people were burned to death when they sought sanctuary in a church in Moyen Chari district."
