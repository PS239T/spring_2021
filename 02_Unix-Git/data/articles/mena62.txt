"Disturbed by charges of Iran's barbarous abuse of its own people, the United Nations last March ordered an inquiry by its Human Rights Commission. Iran has responded predictably. The U.N.'s special representative, Andres Aguilar of Venezuela, was barred from visiting Iran and could not even elicit a reply to detailed accounts of torture and summary executions. Teheran's clerical rulers found time only to send him a boilerplate description of legal procedures. Nonetheless, Mr. Aguilar's interim report, which the General Assembly debates this week, relates Iran's defiance with a needlessly apologetic cough, making allowances for a country waging an interminable war with Iraq. The most Mr. Aguilar will say is that the allegations against Iran ''cannot be dismissed as groundless.'' In fact, Iran's most notorious crime predates the war. Soon after the Shah's fall in 1979, the victorious mullahs started persecuting the largest non-Islamic minority, the 300,000 Bahais. Leaders were executed, adherents denied basic rights, families dissolved and shrines vandalized. Hundreds were murdered, thousands tortured and every Bahai stigmatized as an infidel tool of Satan, Israel and the Shah. The faith's real crime is its existence. Its prophet was a Shiraz merchant who was executed for heresy in 1850. His leading disciple, known as Baha Allah, gave the faith a name and global following. It celebrates the unity of great religions, racial and sexual equality and universal education. The faith's principal shrine is in Haifa, where it has been since Palestine was an Ottoman province. Iran's clerical tyrants scorn the Bahais as an abominable offspring of Shiite Islam. Their intolerance is written into the Constitution, which denies Bahais the protections accorded Christians and Jews. No U.N. inquiry is needed to establish that omission. The General Assembly can atone for a spineless report by holding Iran accountable for a crime with the stench of genocide."
