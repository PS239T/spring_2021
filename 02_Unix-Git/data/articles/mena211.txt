"To the Editor: The land-mine disaster in Iraqi Kurdistan is even greater than you suggest in ""The Soil Yields Terror for Iraq's Kurds"" (news article, April 13). The Baghdad regime mined not only frontier areas, as many governments have done during war or active insurgencies, but also lands deep inside the Kurdish lands, as we document in a forthcoming report. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq did this in a policy of depopulating the Kurdish countryside in the late 1980's, which involved razing as many as 4,000 Kurdish villages and the disappearance of scores of thousands of Kurds who are now presumed dead. Mines were then planted to deter rebels, but also to prevent peasants who had survived from returning home. With much of the Kurdish lands under rebel control, villagers who have gone back to ancestral lands many miles from the frontier are losing their lives or limbs as these mines detonate. Saddam Hussein's indiscriminate use of land mines, like his human rights abuses more generally, makes him stand out in a crowded field.
