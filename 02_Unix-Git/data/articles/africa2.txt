"Slavery is usually thought of as a pre-modern style of political abuse -but that's not entirely accurate, according to a report under study by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The document, based on an inquiry by the Anti-Slavery Society of London, says that in Mauritania, a poor nation of 1.5 million on the western end of the Sahara, there are at least 100,000 slaves and 300,000 serfs and exslaves, subject to severe discrimination. The slaveholders, predominantly white Moors, include ''the upper and middle officials of the Government, the judiciary, the police and the rest of the civil service,'' according to the report. The slaves, who enter their status by birth, capture or purchase, are blacks from Mauritania's southwest region, exploited to tend camels and goats, work in fields and mines and perform household chores. John Mercer, an expert on the Western Sahara who made the inquiry for the society, said that slave transactions are clandestine, with children constituting the biggest trade. Women, used as concubines and producers of slaves, are worth twice as much as men, the study said. Although Mauritania's constitution outlaws slavery, the report charged that Government officials have not enforced the abolition decrees. Theo C. van Boven, director of the Division of Human Rights, said the study ''deserves all the attention it can get,'' but that slavery in Mauritania is ''not only a matter of law but tradition and social custom that can't be done away with overnight.''"
