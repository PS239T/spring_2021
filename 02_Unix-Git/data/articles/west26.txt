"An East German court sentenced Heinz Barth, an SS officer in World War II, to life imprisonment today, calling him a ''murderous rifleman'' who helped massacre 734 villagers in France and Czechoslovakia during the war. The maximum penalty under East German law is death by firing squad, but the prosecution asked for a life term. The 62-year-old defendant answered, ''Yes, I understood,'' when the presiding judge, Heinz Hugot, asked whether he understood that he could appeal within seven days. Neither he nor his state-appointed lawyer indicated that the former SS man would appeal.  The defendant, who had collapsed in sobs while testifying about the massacres and listening to the harrowing accounts of five survivors, kept his composure during today's session. The panel of three judges and one civilian found that the former first lieutenant had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity with malice."
