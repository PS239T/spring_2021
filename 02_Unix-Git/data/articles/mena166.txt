"To the Editor: Sidney Zion is certainly correct (Op-Ed, Jan. 15) when he states that United States foreign policy frequently adheres to a ''do as we say, not as we do'' attitude toward Israel (and others). However, the answer is not to lower moral standards for others, but to meet higher standards in our own actions. Unfortunately, United States support for repressive Central American regimes undermines our leadership in denouncing other instances of human rights violations. To say that a neighboring state's human rights violations justify Israel's use of the same tactics to respond to the intifada only damages Israel's democracy. When a democratic state finds it necessary to put aside requirements of due process and civil rights, it loses some of its democracy along the way. SANDY GOTTLIEB Brooklyn, Jan. 16, 1990"
