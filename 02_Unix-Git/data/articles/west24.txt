"Klaus Barbie, the accused Nazi war criminal awaiting trial for crimes against humanity, came faceto-face today with two French Resistance fighters he is said to have detained as Lyons Gestapo chief during World War II. Officials said the defendant was taken to the former Gestapo headquarters at Fort Montluc, where he was originally held after being extradited to France from Bolivia in February. There he met Elie Nahmias and a woman named by officials as Mrs. de Sainte-Marie. Mr. Nahmias, visibly upset as he left the prison, told reporters: ''Klaus Barbie refused to talk, and there was a reversal of roles. His lawyer interrogated us as if we were the guilty ones.''"
