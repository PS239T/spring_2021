"A retired admiral widely accused of heading Argentina's most notorious torture center in the 1970's has been arrested in connection with the activities of rightist death squads, the federal police said today. The admiral, Ruben Chamorro, was arrested Sunday night at Buenos Aires International Airport as he stepped off a flight from South Africa, a police statement said. The statement said Admiral Chamorro, who had been under growing Government pressure to return from South Africa, was held in connection with a federal judge's investigation into the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance death squads, which were responsible for hundreds of killings. Admiral Chamorro was head of the Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires from 1976 to 1978 at the height of the armed forces' ''dirty war'' against leftist guerrillas. Human rights groups accuse him of running a clandestine torture and interrogation center responsible for the disappearance of up to 4,000 people."
