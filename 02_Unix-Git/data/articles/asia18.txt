"Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said today that there was growing evidence that the Soviet Union might be using Vietnamese dissidents as forced labor to build the Siberian part of its natural gas pipeline to Western Europe. Mr. Weinberger defended the Reagan Administration's sanctions against American companies supplying parts for the pipeline by telling a conference of American, European and Japanese government officials that the reported human rights violations by Moscow were ''potentially horrendous.'' ''The evidence is not conclusive, I hasten to say,'' Mr.  Weinberger remarked. He added that some had found the available evidence ''very persuasive.'' ''The evidence has come from a number of sources, including an important human rights organization in West Germany, that a number of Vietnamese groups are concerned that their political dissidents may have been exported to Siberia to help build the pipeline,'' Mr.  Weinberger said."
