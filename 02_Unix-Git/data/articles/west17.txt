"The Danish chapter of Amnesty International, the human-rights group, said today that Denmark will open the first international rehabilitation center for torture victims. A spokesman for the group, Inge Kemp Genefke, said that the center will open in September 1983, with similar clinics opening later in Paris, Amsterdam and Toronto. Denmark's center, to be staffed by about 50 medical professionals, including nurses, physicians, psychiatrists and physiotherapists, will treat about 300 patients a year, Dr. Genefke said."
