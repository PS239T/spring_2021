"To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman (column, Oct. 22) tacitly applauds Egypt's all-out ""law and order"" battle against Islamist extremists, but ignores this year's rise in state repression -- not only against suspected militants, but also against the nonviolent political opposition and civil society. Hostage-taking of family members, incommunicado detention and torture help fuel the fury of the militants. Military courts have been used since 1992 to prosecute ""terrorists"" in unfair trials; those condemned to death are quickly executed. There is harassment and arrest of lawyers who defend militants. Prisoners are held in appalling conditions, with an alarming rise in deaths this year. At least 26 men have died, most in the infamous Wadi al-Gadid prison. The Government launched an unrelenting crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which plans to compete in the November election. Hundreds of local leaders and activists have been arrested since January. The repression culminated in the decision in August to refer to the military court 49 prominent Muslim Brothers, including elected leaders of professional associations, former Parliament members, doctors, professors and engineers. None were accused of crimes involving violence. Press freedom suffered a major setback in May when Parliament passed a law that mandated imprisonment for broad offenses such as ""publishing false or biased rumors, news and statements or disconcerting propaganda"" if it ""harms the public interest or shows contempt for state institutions or officials."" This erosion of human rights and the rule of law cannot be justified as a response to armed militants. By targeting peaceful critics, the Government is building a shaky future. VIRGINIA N. SHERRY Associate Director Human Rights Watch-Middle East New York, Oct. 24, 1995"
