"To the Editor: ""Asylum by Gender"" (editorial, March 10), your endorsement of the need to recognize gender-based persecution for granting asylum, is welcome, but you raise misleading concerns. You suggest that inclusion of gender-based persecution might open the floodgates to all women fearing discrimination or violence. Gender-based asylum claims are unlikely to be much different from other claims. Each applicant must establish a crucial factor you omit: the role of the state. The Saudi woman who was granted asylum by Canada not only risked persecution if she returned to Saudi Arabia, but also had a well-founded fear of such abuse at the hands of her own government, with no local recourse available. You state that refugee laws ""were not designed to solve every case of spousal abuse."" Right, but they do not respond to every case of racial, religious, national or political violence either. They offer safe haven to people who can establish state-sponsored or tolerated persecution on these grounds. DOROTHY Q. THOMAS REGAN E.
