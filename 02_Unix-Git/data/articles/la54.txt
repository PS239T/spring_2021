"Chile, in its first official reaction to a United Nations resolution condemning its policies, promised today to stop cooperating with the human rights agencies of all international organizations. Foreign Minister Rene Rojas Galdames told reporters the United Nations General Assembly resolution approved on Friday, by a vote of 85 to 17 with 41 abstentions, was invalid because it unfairly focused on Chile for condemnation while ignoring widespread human rights violations in countries such as Cuba. In line with its new policy, Mr. Rojas Galdames said the Chilean Government would reject future statements by a special United Nations observer studying the rights situation here. The United Nations resolution asked the world organization's Human Rights Commission to extend the stay of the observer, Aboulaye Dieye of Senegal, who over the last few years has filed reports condemning Chile's rights violations."
