"Klaus Barbie, the wartime Gestapo chief here, found it unbelievable that he was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison, a defense lawyer said today. ''It's incredible,'' the lawyer, Nabil Bouaita, quoted the 73-year-old defendant as saying before he was taken back to prison. Mr. Bouaita did not elaborate, but said the meeting was short and unemotional. Mr. Barbie's chief lawyer, Jacques Verges, said he would appeal. Three judges and nine jurors deliberated six and a half Friday, finding Mr. Barbie guilty of deporting hundreds of Jews and Resistance members to Nazi death camps."
