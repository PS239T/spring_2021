"K.G.B. agents this week searched the apartment of Georgi N. Vladimov, leader of the Moscow branch of Amnesty International, Mr. Vladimov told Western reporters today. Mr. Vladimov also said he and his wife, Natasha, were told to report to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison on Jan. 4 for questioning. He said he was told during the seven-hour apartment search Tuesday that he was to be interrogated about possible links with a convicted terrorist called Borodin. But the 52-year-old dissident writer said he believed the search was part of a renewed effort to make him move to the West. He said the K.G.B. agents took away manuscripts, letters, books and his two typewriters. It was the second time this year his home has been searched and materials confiscated, he said. Among the documents taken were those related to the London-based human rights groups, the author said."
