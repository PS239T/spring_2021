"Amnesty International said today that since 1969 at least 300 people in the Soviet Union had been detained for political reasons and treated with drugs in psychiatric hospitals. These were only the known cases of what the human rights organization called Soviet abuses of psychiatry, using drugs as a form of punishment. ''Soviet and foreign psychiatrists have privately examined a number of people held in this way and have found no medical basis for their confinement,'' Amnesty International said. It cited the case of one prisoner, Vladimir Tsurikov, a worker from Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, who was confined three times after having repeatedly applying for emigration. Describing the effect of drugs on him, Mr. Tsurikov wrote: ''The triftazin made me writhe. I lost the ability to walk. The pain prevented me from sleeping or eating.'' Amnesty International said it had learned of special psychiatric hospitals that were especially harsh, where inmates had been beaten by convicted criminals serving as orderlies."
