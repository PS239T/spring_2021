"To the Editor: ""Bought and Sold,"" by Charles Jacobs and Mohamed Athie (Op-Ed, July 13), on slavery in Northern Africa, is inaccurate in several important respects. First, the report by Gaspar Biro, a United Nations official, has been criticized by independent sources as being based upon hearsay and anecdotal evidence. Second, slavery has been a criminal offense in the Sudan since the days of British colonial rule, and the existence of a market wherein women are bought and sold for $15 is preposterous. Moreover, slavery is against the fundamental teachings of Islam. Third, the Sudanese Government is a signatory of various international conventions proscribing slavery. ""Civilian Devastation: Abuses by All Parties in the War in Southern Sudan,"" a recent report by Human Rights Watch-Africa, details nearly 300 pages of human rights abuses by all parties in Sudan's 11-year conflict. While making no mention of Government perpetration or support of the slavery practices alleged in the Op-Ed article, the report does cite instances of kidnapping, disappearances and execution by military forces on all sides. Armed conflict is often unable to distinguish between civilians and soldiers, especially when the latter act without authority. Apart from these factual errors, the article fails to mention the recent glimmer of hope that these hostilities may be near an end. It is our hope that the continuing Nairobi talks between the Sudanese Government and rebel factions convened under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development and the appointment of Melissa F. Wells as United States special envoy will bring an end to this ordeal. AHMED SULIMAN Ambassador of the Sudan Washington, July 22, 1994"
