"A report by Amnesty International has accused Moroccan authorities of systematically torturing political prisoners and denying them access to their families, lawyers and doctors. Illegal detention and torture have continued unabated in Morocco since the 1970's, the report by the London-based human rights organization said. Although the report says that periods of detention are limited by the Moroccan Code of Criminal Procedure, Amnesty International asserts that authorities are regularly exceeding these legal limits, particularly in the cases of people jailed for political or religious dissent. According to the organization, these prisoners are often held incommunicado for months, and in some cases years, at a time. In a statement written in response to the report, the Moroccan Ambassador to the United States, Maati Jorio, expressed his concern ''about the hostile propaganda effort directed once again by Amnesty International.'' He called the report an effort to tarnish Morocco's image in the United States."
