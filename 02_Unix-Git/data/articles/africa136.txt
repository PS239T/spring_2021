"Revenge killings and abductions of Hutu people in Rwanda occurred by the hundreds if not thousands in many parts of the country, according to the findings of a report by Amnesty International. The Amnesty report, issued on Wednesday, comes less than a month after the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported human rights abuses by the Tutsi-led army in Rwanda. Rwanda's President, Pasteur Bizimungu, told reporters early this month that he was aware of some abuses."
