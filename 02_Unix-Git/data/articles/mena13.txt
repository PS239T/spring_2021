"To the Editor: In his letter of April 3 the Press Counselor of the Embassy of Turkey refers to ''a unanimously signed report to Amnesty International testifying to the fact that not only is torture not practiced in Turkey but that it is a crime under the Turkish Constitution and the Turkish penal code.'' Amnesty International's research department in London has yet to receive any such report. It continues to receive, however, reports of torture and deaths in detention - violations, of course, of both Turkish and international law. The Turkish press has recently reported two more deaths in detention and Amnesty now has the names of 20 people reported to have died in custody since the military coup in September. Amnesty has received the names of 22 people alleged to have been tortured in the city of Denizli, including a 62-year-old woman, Havana Bagislmais, who is reported to have received electric shocks. While Amnesty, of course, welcomes statements by the Turkish Government that it will investigate these reports, it has no basis for modifying its statement to the Council of Europe that torture in Turkey is continuing systematically and on a large scale. LARRY COX, Press Officer, Amnesty International U.S.A., New York, April 8, 1981"
