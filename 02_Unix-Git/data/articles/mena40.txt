"Two Iranian judges have been dismissed for overstepping their authority, the Teheran radio reported today.  The revolutionary prosecutors of the northeastern town of Birjand and the southern town of Bushire have been dismissed for ''repeated violations and inhuman and un-Islamic behavior in their posts,'' the radio said. Other judges and other Iranian officials have been arrested or dismissed for abusing their power in the two weeks since Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, attacked Islamic tribunals and revolutionary committees for arbitrary arrests and other human rights violations and urged judges to exercise their legal power impartially. Two days ago, the Teheran radio reported that Ayatollah Khomeini had appointed a clergyman to head a court to try religious judges who abused their powers."
