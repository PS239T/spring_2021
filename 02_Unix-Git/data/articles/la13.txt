"Amnesty International said in a report distributed today that it had ''conclusive evidence'' that the Government of Colombia systematically used beatings, drugs, electrical shock, rape and other forms of torture on its opponents. The London-based human-rights organization said the report was based on the work of investigators who visited the South American country in January. The report said there were 35 centers across Colombia where beatings, burnings, the use of drugs, electric shock, rape, and other systematic torture of political opponents occurred. ''Peasants, Indians and trade unionists suffered particularly from these abuses,'' the report said. It said doctors, lawyers and others who tried to uphold professional codes of conduct also were tortured."
