"France today recalled its Ambassador from Chile, calling Gen. Augusto Pinochet a ''curse on his people'' and accusing the Government of human rights violations after demonstrations against it. Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson told the National Assembly that Ambassador Leon Bouvier had been recalled for consultations.  The French radio quoted Mr. Cheysson as saying, ''General Pinochet is a curse on his people.'' Earlier, Max Gallo, a Government spokesman, told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that the Government was outraged by events in Chile.  Chilean soldiers and policemen arrested hundreds of people after nationwide demonstrations against the Government last week. Two youths were shot dead during protests in Santiago."
