"To the Editor: In a May 15 news article on land confiscation in Jerusalem, you make a groundless allegation in characterizing the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem as having a ""pro-Palestinian bias."" The organization's ""bias"" is neither pro- nor anti-Palestinian or Israeli. Its partiality is toward the promotion of human rights in the occupied territories. In the six years since its founding, B'Tselem has gained the professional respect of international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The State Department's yearly human rights report relies on information provided by B'Tselem. B'Tselem reports of human rights violations have stimulated Knesset debates, official state commissions of inquiry and criminal proceedings. B'Tselem reports have ranged from the use of torture by Israeli authorities to the role of Palestinian political organizations in the killing of Palestinian collaborators. B'Tselem can critique the laxness of Israeli authorities in enforcing the law against illegal actions by Jewish settlers, while also critiquing actions by these same authorities, such as administrative detention, which deprive the settlers of basic rights. YIZHAR BE'ER Executive Director, B'Tselem Jerusalem, May 18, 1995"
