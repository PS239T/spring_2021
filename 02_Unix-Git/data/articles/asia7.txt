"The United Nations Human Rights Commission accused Vietnam today of occupying Cambodia and criticized the Soviet Union for its intervention in Afghanistan. Neither country was mentioned by name. The resolution on Afghanistan said the commission was ''gravely concerned at the continued foreign armed intervention in Afghanistan.'' The resolution was sponsored by Islamic and other third-world nations. The Western-backed resolution on Cambodia, which is called Kampuchea by the Cambodians, said that ''gross and flagrant violations of human rights'' had continued to occur there and added that ''the primary violation of human rights in Kampuchea at present is the persistence of foreign occupation.''"
