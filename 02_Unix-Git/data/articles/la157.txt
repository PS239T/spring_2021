"A State Department official said today that United States news organizations had been negligent in failing to portray the Cuban leader Fidel Castro as ''one of the most vicious tyrants of our time.'' The official, Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said Cuba is criticized less than relatively open societies are in the American press because restrictions imposed by Cuba had limited access to reliable information. He said news organizations should compensate by trying harder to expose abuses of human rights in Cuba. Referring to the release in June of 26 Cuban political prisoners to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Abrams said, ''Ask yourself: Of all the newspapers and TV stations which reported the release of the 26 Cuban political prisoners, how many had ever previously carried one story on the existence of political prisoners in Cuba? The media are simply not covering this story.''"
