"President Daniel arap Moi has bitterly attacked the visit of Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, who came here last week to present a human rights award to a Kenyan lawyer. Ms. Kennedy, while here with her mother, Ethel, criticized Kenya's human rights record as well as recent changes in the Constitution that increase the power of the police and diminish the independence of judges. In addition, Mrs. Kennedy asked in a meeting with Mr. Moi that the lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, be given back his passport, which was confiscated when he sued the Government charging mistreatment of prisoners."
