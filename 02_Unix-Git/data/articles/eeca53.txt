"Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in Poland for an official visit, today condemned human rights abuses, including violations of labor union freedoms. Speaking at Jagiellonian University in the southern city of Cracow, he said some countries paid only lip service to civil, political, economic, social, religious and union liberties. His speech was published by the Polish press agency Interpress. Mr. Perez de Cuellar named no countries in his remarks. He said that ''important human rights - civil and political, economic and social, religious and trade union - continue too frequently to be ignored.''"
