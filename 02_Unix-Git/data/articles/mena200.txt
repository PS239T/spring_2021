"To the Editor: We, as steering committee members of the Congressional Committee to Support Writers and Journalists, share the concerns raised in your Sept 7 report on Turkish use of force against Kurds, describing human rights abuses by both guerrilla and Government forces in Turkey. We join proponents of freedom of expression in calling attention to the danger to journalists in Turkey. Since last February, at least nine journalists have been killed -- and many more wounded -- usually following work-related threats. It appears Turkish authorities have not made serious efforts to investigate fully these attacks and prosecute those responsible. Indeed, it is widely believed by journalists that Turkish security forces may be responsible for some of these attacks. We call on the Turkish Government to protect freedom of expression and support the brave men and women who work in this hazardous environment. (Senator) WILLIAM COHEN (Senator) BOB GRAHAM (Representative) BILL GREEN (Representative) JOHN LEWIS Washington, Sept. 25, 1992"
