"The military Government legalized political opposition and instituted press freedoms today, keeping to a timetable set to create a multiparty democracy by the end of the year. The reforms would end 13 years of dictatorship in the West African nation. All parties except Islamic groups will be permitted, reflecting the military's fear of fundamentalist movements. The country's leader, Col. Maawiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya, began the changes after opposition unrest and threats of strikes to seek his overthrow. He promised to bring democracy to this sparsely populated desert nation of 1.6 million people when he took power in 1984. Opposition groups say he is making changes now as a ploy to enhance an image tarnished by brutal repression and corruption. Human rights organizations contend that more than 200 black political detainees have been executed or tortured to death since October. Dark-skinned people of Africandescent are a minority in this North African nation dominated by light-skinned people of Moorish descent. Slavery was abolished in 1980, but human rights groups say the practice continues."
