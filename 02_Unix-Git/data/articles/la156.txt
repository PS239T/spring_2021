"Riot policemen fired tear gas and water cannon today at hundreds of demonstrators massing to protest human rights abuses attributed to Government troops pursuing Maoist guerrillas in the country's Andes region. Nearly 2,000 people chanting ''No more violence!'' were driven by security forces out of Campo de Marti, the park where they had gathered for a march called by leftist groups. Policemen in armored vehicles equipped with water cannon chased small groups of demonstrators throughout downtown Lima late today as tear gas wafted into office buildings and caused traffic jams. President Fernando Belaunde Terry put the city of six million under military control earlier today to prevent the march, saying the Government had received intelligence reports indicating Maoist guerrillas would infiltrate the protest and provoke riots. The march, set for this afternoon, was called by Lima's leftist Mayor, Alfonso Barrantes, major unions and opposition political parties. Meanwhile, in the Andean city of Huanta, forensic doctors began autopsies on the tortured bodies of 49 young men and a woman found piled into four common graves in Peru's guerrilla war zone. Some of the bodies were found nude and with their hands tied behind their backs, the authorities said. They said most would be impossible to identify. Sobbing Indian women crowded outside the hospital in Huanta, an Andean city 250 miles southeast of Lima, to learn if the victims were family members who disappeared in recent weeks as the Peruvian military intensified its battle against the Shining Path guerrillas. The area is under military control. Justice officials, acting on a tip from local peasants, found the graves Thursday 10 miles outside of Huanta."
