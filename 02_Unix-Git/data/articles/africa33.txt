"Amnesty International expressed ''grave fears'' tonight for the safety of prisoners detained in South Africa under emergency regulations introduced July 21. The human rights organization said in a statement here that it had started receiving disturbing reports of torture of political detainees since the emergency was declared and expressed concern over the fact that South African security forces had been granted immunity in advance for any acts they commit under their new powers. A spokesman for the South African Embassy in London said that he was not aware of any specific allegations of torture and that the South African Government definitely forbids its use. The spokesman, Gerrit Pretorius, third secretary in the information department, also said that half of those detained had subsequently been released. Amnesty International said some 1,400 political detentions had been reported in the three weeks since the emergency was decreed compared with 1,000 detained under security regulations in all of 1984. The organization said that large numbers of detainees were being held incommunicado at secret locations and that their relatives were denied information about their whereabouts. Amnesty International said those reported to have been assaulted in custody included students, labor leaders and priests. It said some were reported to have been hooded, beaten and tortured with electric shocks. Others, the organization said, have been threatened with execution."
