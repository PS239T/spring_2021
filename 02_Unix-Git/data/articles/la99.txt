"Christian Democrats from 15 countries sponsored a major rally here Monday night and called on Chile's military rulers to move toward democracy. Andres Zaldivar, president of the Christian Democratic International, told the meeting of 5,000 people that military governments in Latin America had been disastrous. ''At this moment,'' said Mr. Zaldivar, a former Chilean Finance Minister, ''Argentina is emerging into democracy and we salute it with joy. Tomorrow, it will be Uruguay and Brazil - and why not Chile?'' The rally in a Santiago theater was the culmination of two days of Christian Democratic International meetings and was the biggest event for the Chilean Christian Democratic Party in a decade of military rule by the Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The last such major gathering of Christian Democrats in Chile was for the funeral nearly two years ago of Eduardo Frei Montalva, a Christian Democrat who served as President from 1964 to 1970. West Germany's Health Minister, Heiner Geissler, called for concrete steps by the Pinochet Government toward democracy, including an end to human rights abuses, the legalization of political parties and conditions for free trade unions."
