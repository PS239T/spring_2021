"To the Editor: If only Israeli-Palestinian peace were as easy to attain as Anthony Lewis suggests in recent columns from Jerusalem (March 20, 24, 27). Replete with stale rhetoric and platitudes that blame Israel for current obstacles, the columns downplay the unprecedented progress reached thus far in the IsraeliPalestinian relationship, as well as the Palestinian-based factors that have led to the delay in further implementation of Palestinian self-rule. Mr. Lewis pays only lip service to Islamic extremist terrorism, which has claimed more than 120 lives since September 1993 and has made Israelis justifiably fear for their personal safety and security. It is the heinous actions of the young Hamas suicide bombers who are inculcated with an ideology of violence and martyrdom that is to blame for delays in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Although Mr. Lewis acknowledges some failings of the Palestinian authority -- human rights abuses, the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat's autocratic style, his refusal to provide an accounting of how he will use international funds and his lack of resolve in reining in Islamic militants -- Mr. Lewis still assigns Israel the primary responsibility for the deterioration of the peace process. For Mr. Lewis, Israel always seems to be the party most deserving of blame. It is unfortunate that the bold risks Israel is taking for peace and the cost in human life it is paying have not much affected his assessment of the situation in the region. ABRAHAM H. FOXMAN National Director Anti-Defamation League New York, March 31, 1995"
