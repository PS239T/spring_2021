"Amnesty International, the human rights group, said in a report issued yesterday that thousands of civilians in East Timor had disappeared or had been illegally detained, tortured and executed by the Indonesian forces of President Suharto's Government. The report, based on accounts by victims, witnesses and official documents, said about 100,000 civilians have been killed and thousands of others imprisoned since December 1975. Indonesian Government officials dispute Amnesty International's charges, saying that other humanitarian agencies have been granted regular access to East Timor."
