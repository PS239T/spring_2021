"Turkey's new coalition Government promised to move vigorously against human rights abuses when it took office last November. A year later, there's little movement -- as shown, for example, by the the Government's appalling indifference to the serial murders of Turkish journalists. The other day Musa Anter, 74 years old, became the ninth journalist killed since February. Mr. Anter worked for pro-Kurdish publications, as did all but one of the victims. Few dispute that Turkey is seriously tormented by a tiny faction of Kurdish terrorists; it's the hunting license given to police and military that stirs criticism. Oktay Eksi, president of the Turkish Press Council, said that until now he has doubted claims that the security forces have been involved. But after the Musa Anter killing he was moved to add, ""I cannot help but believe that Anter too has been killed by the notorious state force called 'counter-guerrilla' . . . ."" That might explain why Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's Government has been unable to make any arrests in any of the nine murders."
