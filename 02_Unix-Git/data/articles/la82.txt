"Leftist protesters who seized the Brazilian Embassy here on Wednesday released their eight hostages, including the Brazilian Ambassador, tonight and were granted safe conduct out of the country, reportedly to Mexico. A Guatemalan Government spokesman said the agreement was worked out by a Brazilian negotiating team that arrived earlier in the day. About 20 members of groups representing Indians and peasants had seized the embassy and the hostages, including Ambassador Antonio Carlos de Abreu e Silva, saying they wanted to draw attention to what they called the continuing massacres of peasants, most of whom are Indians, in the rural mountainous areas. The leftists say some 3,000 peasants have been murdered by the army since a military coup here in late March.  One of the leftists' main demands was a forum to denounce what they said was an increase in human rights violations since the coup."
