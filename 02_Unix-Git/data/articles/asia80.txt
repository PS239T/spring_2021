"To the Editor: Your editorial, a laudable piece with great emotional quality, helps maintain awareness of an almost forgotten tragedy, but it is 10 years late and fails to discuss the greater danger of the Vietnamese occupation. In fact, the fundamental issue of Cambodia's survival remains unaddressed. One should recall that in 1977 Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States and the International Commission of Jurists started to raise the human rights issue against Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, but these efforts ran into objections by the Soviet bloc. Since 1975 Cambodian refugees have demonstrated every year, in New York, Washington and other major cities, against Khmer Rouge atrocities. Their calls have gone unheeded. After the Vietnamese invasion and subsequent occupation of Cambodia, many self-appointed Cambodia experts suddenly began to condemn Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. Hardly anything has been said about Communist Vietnam's new model of colonialism in Cambodia. The policy is being pursued by Vietnamese occupation forces and colonizers, which constitute about one-sixth of Cambodia's population and are protected by extraterritoriality. This is the equivalent of having 40 million Russians in the U.S. who can steal, kill and rape without being subjected to American laws. The memory of Pol Pot's victims would be honored only if all Khmer Rouge officials involved in the genocide, including those in Vietnamese-controlled regime, were tried along with the Vietnamese colonialists. Until freedom, independence and democracy is restored to Cambodia, any other course would be a disservice to the Cambodian people and would perpetuate instability in Southeast Asia.
