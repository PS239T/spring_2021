"AS many others have noted, the Holocaust is a story that can't be told by just anyone. If the unfathomable horrors of Nazi genocide are to remain forever in the forefront of the world's conscience, they must be conveyed by writers, historians and artists who can make them as palpable as is humanly possible. (No one, after all, can truly recreate the Holocaust for those who didn't experience it.) Simply put, this means that hacks have no right to use this piece of history as a grazing ground. Slipshod dramatizations don't keep the nightmare fresh. They trivialize it, depersonalize it, distance it.  They turn the Holocaust into popcorn entertainment that audiences can all too comfortably consume and forget. This, I'm afraid, is precisely what has happened with a new play called ''The Survivor,'' which opened at the Morosco last night. No doubt the people behind this production have good intentions. No doubt they sincerely wish to remind us not only of the Nazis' crimes, but also of those heroic Jews who struggled for freedom within the inferno of the Warsaw Ghetto. But this show is a banality: it turns history into a bland and tedious compilation of showbiz cliches. The author is Susan Nanus, who has adapted a memoir by Jack Eisner, a Holocaust survivor. According to the program, Miss Nanus interviewed other survivors as well, but one has to wonder if she really listened to them. Each of her characters has been assigned a single personality trait so that each might neatly represent a different kind of Warsaw Jew. Instead of a cross-section of humanity, we get a smorgasbord of stereotypes. Jacek (David Marshall Grant), the hero of the evening, is the ringleader of a teen-age food-smuggling ring: he's impetuous. One of his cohorts is defined exclusively by his Hasidic roots, one by his wealthy airs, one by his constant comical use of an expletive.  Jacek's father is ''a man of books'': This means that he carries a book in every scene, wears spectacles and repeatedly reaffirms his mistaken conviction that ''the war will be over soon.'' Grandma (Lilia Skala) is a cartoonish matriarch. Sister (Loren Brown) is a shamefully hollowed-out caricature of Anne Frank. These people may have all existed in Warsaw - but not in this twodimensional, one-note form. By failing to bring any of them to compelling life, Miss Nanus has transformed the Nazis' victims into bloodless statistics. Yet, even if she had put real people on stage, one would still have to quarrel with the way she sanitizes their deaths. The murders are stylized, and they are each followed by a monologue in which the deceased character stands in a spotlight to describe his or her demise. This arty, sentimentalizing device, last seen to no effect in ''Goodbye Fidel,'' has the effect of taking the sting out of the horror. In one of these posthumous speeches, a dead woman even announces that she ''hardly felt a thing.'' But the six million did feel something as they were butchered - and they weren't allowed the luxury of coming back to tell the world what those feelings were. Miss Nanus doesn't do justice to the story that contains these people, either. ''The Survivor'' tries to recount the ghetto uprising, but the playwright plunges from her plodding exposition right to her frantic resolution, leaving history in tatters. So lame is the writing that Miss Nanus must finally rely on recorded music to convey the play's moods, trashy sound effects to signify terror and a chorus of extras to fill in factual information. For humor, there's the expected sprinkling of Yiddishisms. For a love story, there's a furtive across-the-wall romance that is told in the perfunctory manner of the ''We Kiss in a Shadow'' subplot of ''The King and I.'' The production, which unfolds on Steven Rubin's three-level set, is severely cramped by the text. Craig Anderson, the director, has assembled a cast of ciphers - or, in some cases, very talented actors (Mr. Grant, Joanna Merlin) who have little choice but to play at a single, emphatic pitch. Even Jacek's gang of brave boys lacks any convincing spontaneity as they dash about to perform their acts of derring-do. They come off instead like Dead End Kids who have been unaccountably cleaned up and taught manners at an American prep school. In the end, Jacek survives. He announces that he has told his tale so that his martyred friends will never become ''part of the nameless, faceless dead.'' Yet ''The Survivor'' achieves exactly the reverse of its hero's claim. Pure as the intent may be, the results are callous all the same. A Memoir Adapted THE SURVIVOR, by Susan Nanus, based on a book by Jack Eisner.
