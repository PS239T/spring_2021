"To the Editor: Re ""Moderates Gain in Jordanian Parliament"" (news article, Nov. 6): Voters were confronted not only with a boycott of the elections -- which was supported by eight secular political parties, not just Islamists -- but also with increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. Not surprisingly, these restrictions topped the list of the boycotters' grievances. Foremost among the grievances were the draconian amendments to the press law, enacted in May. This law led to the suspension of 13 newspapers weeks before the elections and forced journalists to follow a stricter self-censorship to avoid heavy financial penalties. Article 195 of the penal code, which makes it a criminal offense to insult the dignity of King Hussein, has also been used to prosecute and imprison critics. In such a climate of mounting state restrictions on basic freedoms, can one still speak of free and fair elections?
