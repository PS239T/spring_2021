"President Reagan said today that human rights were being violated in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ''on a continuing and regular basis.'' He made the accusation in a proclamation designating Aug. 1 as Helsinki Human Rights Day, marking the eighth anniversary of the 1975 Helsinki accords. The accords, covering East-West cooperation, including human rights issues, were signed in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, by 33 governments of Eastern and Western Europe, along with the United States and Canada. ''The suppression of the trade union Solidarity in Poland, the continuing acts of repression directed against the Helsinki monitors, the drastic decrease in the level of emigration from the Soviet Union, and the harassment and persecution throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe of citizens attempting to express their religious and political freedoms flagrantly denies the principles of Helsinki agreed to by the respective governments,'' the proclamation said. ''These repressive actions not only threaten the achievement of genuine security and cooperation in Europe, but have a chilling effect on the human spirit of the brave peoples enduring this tyranny.'' Mr. Reagan said the human rights observance permitted Americans to demonstrate ''solidarity with the peoples of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, whose basic human rights are being violated by their governments on a continuing and regular basis.''"
