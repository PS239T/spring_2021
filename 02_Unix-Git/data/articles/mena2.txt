"To the Editor: I agree that the United States owes the people of Iran an apology for violations committed by the Shah's regime, but I cannot agree that this apology be directed toward the Iranian Government. he United States owes nothing to the Ayatolla Khomeini's Government, undeniably a violator of human rights itself. Instead, it is the obligation of the Iranian Government, on both moral and legal grounds, to release the hostages without any further delay.  PETER STERNBERG Philadelphia, Sept. 26, 1980"
