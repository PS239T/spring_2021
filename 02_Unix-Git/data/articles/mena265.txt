"Some 2,000 lawyers shouted anti-Government slogans at the offices of an Egyptian bar association today to protest the death in police custody of a lawyer who represented Muslim militants. Human right groups in Egypt and abroad said they suspected that the Government had tortured the lawyer, Abdel-Harith Madani, to death. [The bar association, which is dominated by Muslim militants, said Mr. Madani died after state security investigators in the Cairo suburb of Giza gave him electric shocks, burned his body and whipped him, Reuters reported. It called his death ""premeditated murder.""]  The Egyptian authorities began a crackdown two years against the country's fundamentalist movement, which is wageing a violent campaign to overthrow the country's secular government. Mr. Madani, 30, was arrested at his office in Cairo on April 26. On May 6, the police called Mr. Madani's family and told them to collect his body, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said. Asked how Mr. Madani died, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said he did not know whether a medical problem or another factor had caused Mr. Madani's death. ""What do you expect the Government to say? He died God's death,"" the spokesman said. ""We never violate human rights."""
