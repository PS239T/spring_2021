"No finer compliment has been paid Human Rights Watch than for its application for consultative status at the United Nations to be rejected. It was blocked by a minority of a 19-member committee that has to decide unanimously which private groups should be allowed to address U.N. committees and circulate staff papers. America's largest, most wide-ranging human rights organization was found wanting by six flagrant rights abusers: Cuba, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Algeria and the Sudan. As it happens, Human Rights Watch has published devastating reports on violations of rudimentary norms in each of these countries except Libya, which first agreed and then refused to admit a monitoring team. Cuba, which led the fight, castigated the organization for its ""irreverent"" criticism of China's massacre of student dissidents. For gall, first prize goes to Iraq, where dissenters are gassed or disappear in tanks of acid. Iraq's spokesman alleged that some of the group's officers, because they are Jews, were hostile to certain Arab states. The charge of bigotry comes with peculiar infelicity from a regime that kills Jews because they are Jews and Kurds because they are Kurds. And in any case, Watch monitors have prepared hard-hitting reports on Israel's violation of Palestinian rights in occupied territories. Indeed, the organization's reputation for fairness helps explain the support for its application from such longtime targets of its criticism as the Soviet Union and Chile. But with enemies like the Gang of Six, who needs friends?"
