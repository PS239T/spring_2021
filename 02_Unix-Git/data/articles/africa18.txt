"To the Editor:  Your Aug. 11 editorial ''What Uganda's Flag Is Hiding'' raises some disturbing and complex issues, which I know from personal experiences. When I reported to Kampala in June 1972 as the U.S. Ambassador, Idi Amin was classified as one of the many dictators in the world. Within a few months I knew that he was a murderous tyrant and so advised Washington. But the dilemma that is true today was true then. When the butchery is only against the country's people, what does an external sovereign power do? While the torture and killings in Uganda were horrendous under the dictatorship of Amin and while the present ruler, Dr. Obote, is no villainous tyrant, he seems unable to curb the massacres now going on. Despite this, any unilateral interference by any power would be ill advised; it would only cause greater problems.  But as a major power, we should say what is fact, and we can consequently be indebted to the U.S. Department of State for reporting these conditions in Uganda.  The one body empowered by its charter to assure the noble mission of intervening to save a people from its own tyrannical government is the United Nations. The tragedy is that in the past decade there have been several cases where that body could have taken action as the conscience of the world but did not. World opinion about the efficacy of the United Nations is at an all-time low. Instead of useless debate, where several nations are the constant victims of selective outrage in U.N. resolutions, the U.N. should look for ways to improve its ability to take some kind of action in these obvious cases of human suffering, as in Uganda today. This would be good for the people suffering in these areas. It would also help restore the United Nations to the higher level of respect it once had.
