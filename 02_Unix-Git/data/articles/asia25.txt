"Two leaders of Buddhism in Vietnam have been jailed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese Buddhists in Paris said today. They said Thich Huyen Quang, acting chairman of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, and Thich Quang Do, executive secretary of the church, were arrested on Feb. 25. ''The two monks were jailed because people in Ho Chi Minh City manifested their discontent against the Government by attending massively prayer meetings in temples,'' church representatives here said in a statement. In recent years, the statement said, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam has been ''the only organization that dared to speak out against repression and violation of human rights in Vietnam.'' ''In the present desperate situation, the United Buddhist Church is considered as a source of hope for the people of Vietnam, just as Solidarity is for the people of Poland,'' it added."
