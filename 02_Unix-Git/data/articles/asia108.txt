"To the Editor: I am responding to your Feb. 26 letters on the treatment of Koreans in Japan and on the Korean economy as an American who has lived in Asia for 20 years. Ross R. Zarub obviously spoke to different Koreans from the ones I did and got very different answers about their plight in Japan. He whitewashes the role of Japan in the fate of Korea (and in brutally ravishing the country during World War II). Any Korean living in Japan well knows the subtle and not-so-subtle discriminations still practiced against them. Koreans are merely trying to end these discriminations, and to describe their presence and their justifiable resistance to discrimination as a ''fifth column of sorts inside Japan'' is nonsense. Although there are many valid points in Katharine T. Baker-Carr's letter, to state that ''The majority of Koreans live in abject poverty'' is as untrue as it is ridiculous. I join her in hoping for the best for Koreans and in wishing President Reagan's Administration would stop ''glossing over human rights violations'' in Korea (and elsewhere), but to overstate one's case is to lose it, and I can assure her that the plight of the majority of Korean people in the countryside and in the cities is not desperate. DEAN BARRETT New York, Feb. 29, 1988"
