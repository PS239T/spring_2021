"A Paris court decided today to press new charges against Klaus Barbie, the World War II head of the Gestapo in Lyons, but the move may delay his trial until 1987, judicial sources said. A section of the Appeals Court ruled that Mr. Barbie, who is already charged with killing Jews, will also be tried in connection with two cases involving the death of members of the French Resistance, the sources said. The decision ended several months of legal wrangling over Mr. Barbie's case. He was to be tried last month on charges stemming from the deportation and death of more than 400 Jews, charges that fall into the category of ''crimes against humanity,'' for which there is no immunity. But other lawyers wanted the charges widened to include crimes against the Resistance."
