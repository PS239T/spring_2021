"Amnesty International charged today that the security police in the eastern African nation of Djibouti had tortured as many as 300 prisoners in the last year. The London-based human rights organization said police brutality led to the deaths of 10 people the day after they were arrested two months ago in a roundup of suspected criminals. In its first major report on the country, a tiny former French colony on the Red Sea between Ethiopia and Somalia, Amnesty also accused Djibouti's Government of arbitrarily detaining political opponents without charges or trials. In the report, sent to news organizations in Kenya's capital, a media center for coverage of East Africa, Amnesty said it was ""calling on the Government to urgently tackle both the problem of torture and other human rights issues."" Hassan Gouled Aptidon has been president of Djibouti since its independence from France in 1977. He imposed a one-party state, and a banned opposition movement is based in Paris. The organization said the police systematically tortured more than 200 members of a Somali clan arrested in the capital in October 1990, after the bombing of a cafe in which one person was killed and 14 injured. And it said that scores of members of the Afar ethnic group, the largest group in northern Ethiopia, were also tortured after their arrest in January after an attack on a Djibouti army barracks."
