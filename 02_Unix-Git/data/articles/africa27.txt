"Zimbabwe has rejected charges by Amnesty International that it has increased the detention and torture of suspected Government opponents, the country's embassy in Britain said today. Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister, Enos Nkala, met Monday with officials of Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization, and said its report contained false allegations. Amnesty reported beatings, electric shocks and other torture at Government detention camps since a general election in Zimbabwe in July. An embassy spokesman said Mr. Nkala expressed a willingness to meet with anyone who had been tortured if Amnesty International were to produce him. He also said anyone guilty of torture would be prosecuted. An Amnesty International spokesman described the meeting as useful but said the organization would not bring forth people who had provided evidence of torture."
