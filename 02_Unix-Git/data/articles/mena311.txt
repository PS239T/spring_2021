"To the Editor: Randy Schain's description of his 36 hours under arrest for smoking marijuana (Op-Ed, March 9) smacks of terrorism. Handcuffed from behind on the floor of a van for four hours; 36 hours in different holding cells handcuffed half the time; overcrowded, filthy cells with poor ventilation, abusive guards; being held 12 hours longer in pre-arraignment detention than state law allows -- these are the sort of human rights violations one would expect in Baghdad, not Manhattan. DAVID ROCKWELL New York, March 12, 1996"
