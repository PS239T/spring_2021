"To the Editor: In recent weeks, it has been revealed that the United Nations archives contain a list of 40,000 suspected Nazi war criminals and that detailed files exist for most of them. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's representative to the United Nations, has asked to have those files made available for study and analysis. In the aftermath of the election of Kurt Waldheim as President of Austria, action on that request seems more urgent than ever. Many of the files have been marked with an ''A,'' indicating that the person has actually been accused of war crimes. It is irresponsible to the victims of the Holocaust to allow such accusations to be buried in old archives. The validity or invalidity of the accusations should be investigated and the findings brought to light. That more than 40 years have passed since the crimes were committed is no reason to let the files remain unopened and unexamined. If the people are still alive, let them suffer the consequences of full public disclosure: shame and, if warranted, prosecution. If they are dead, they should not be allowed to lie in peace in their graves. The victims of Nazi war crimes do not even have graves, let alone peace. The immediate and thorough examination of these files is important for understanding the past, for punishment of the guilty and as a warning that anyone who commits crimes against humanity will never be safe from condemnation and prosecution, no matter how long it takes to reveal the crime. HASKEL LOOKSTEIN President, New York Board of Rabbis New York, June 12, 1986"
