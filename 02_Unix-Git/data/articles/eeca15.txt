"Twelve dissidents serving sentences at a labor camp in the Urals conducted a one-day hunger strike on Monday to support demands for status as political prisoners, the wife of one said today. Irina Orlov told reporters that her husband, Yuri, who was a member of a human rights monitoring group, Father Gleb Yakunin, an Orthodox priest, and 10 others took part in the hunger strike. Mrs. Orlov said the prisoners were also protesting Soviet violations of the human rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki agreement on European security and cooperation. She said her husband was planning an extended hunger strike to protest what she called unjustified confiscation of books, letters and scientific notes."
