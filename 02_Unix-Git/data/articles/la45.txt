"The United Nations Human Rights Commission decided today to have a special representative investigate the reported ""grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms"" in El Salvador. In a resolution adopted by 29 votes to 1, with 11 abstentions, the commission said that the special investigator is to present his findings at its next annual session after making an interim report to the General Assembly this fall. Only Uruguary voted against the proposal, which was submitted by Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.  The United States abstained because of objections to a reference in the text of what it views as an ambiguous resolution in which the General Assembly called on ""all governments"" to refrain from sending arms to El Salvador. Richard Schifter, the United States representative, called on the commission to examine ""intensively"" all types of human rights abuses in El Salvador so that they ""may be brought to a speedy halt."""
