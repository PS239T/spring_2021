"The issues raised by the controversy evoke strong reactions and painful memories. A mere 40 years ago the Nazi campaign to dehumanize and deligitimize the Jewish people resulted in the genocide of European Jewry. It is impossible to disassociate that tragedy from contemporary statements which deligitimize Israel. The comparison of Zionism with Nazism implies that Israel's enemies have the right to destroy her as the Allies once sought the eradication of Nazism. I do not expect the Stony Brook administration or faculty to become the spokespeople for Jewish sensitivities. Most tragic in this unfortunate controversy is the failure of university leaders to defend those values of the university community which exist alongside academic freedom. It is a university's responsibility to encourage open discussion, to foster understanding among the disparate groups which it brings together, and to convey to the next generation civilization's acquired store of knowledge about the complexity of the world. Propagandistic slogans asserting that Zionism is akin to racism and Nazism stifle dialogue, spawn hate and suspicion, and falsely suggest simplistic responses to situations which defy solutions. The failure of the administration and faculty at Stony Brook to disassociate themselves from statements which exacerbate prejudice and mistrust has tarnished the moral stature of Stony Brook. The university's inability to define clearly the desirable boundaries of discourse at Stony Brook bespeaks confusion about the fundamental purposes of a university.
