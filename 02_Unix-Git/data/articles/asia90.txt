"The Government released 281 political prisoners today as part of a broad amnesty, and some of the freed prisoners vowed to topple President Roh Tae Woo and drive United States forces out of South Korea. Mr. Roh ordered the amnesty involving just over 2,000 ''politically motivated offenders'' as part of efforts to defuse a nationwide furor over demands for the punishment of former President Chun Doo Hwan for human rights abuses and corruption during his seven years in power. In addition to the releases, the Justice Ministry said the civil rights of 1,581 dissidents were restored, the sentences of 92 people were shortened, and 61 fugitive radical students were dropped from police wanted lists. Dissidents charged that 300 political prisoners remained in jail, and dismissed the amnesty as a trick by the Government to perpetuate its control. Released prisoners and supporters called for Mr. Roh's ouster and the expulsion of American troops based in the country. Those Still Imprisoned Justice Ministry officials said 224 ''anti-state criminals'' remain in jail, but said nearly all are North Korean spies. Mr. Roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive Mr. Chun and promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures to wipe out vestiges of the Chun autocracy. Many South Koreans still identify Mr. Roh with his predecessor, although the new Government has dismantled authoritarian controls and helped introduce political reforms. Mr. Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in 1980, went into internal exile last month after apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule. Among those whose civil rights were restored today was Kim Tae Kun, a leading dissident who won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. Mr. Kim, released in June, drew five years in 1986 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Government and spreading propaganda benefiting the Communist North."
