"Amnesty International said yesterday that 2,600 Indians and peasants of Guatemala, many of them women and children, had been massacred since Gen. Efrain Rios Montt took power in March. It said it had heard that military and civil defense units carried out torture, mutilation and mass executions in at least 112 separate actions between March and July this year. In mid-August, the international human rights organization said that 2,186 poor Indians had been killed since the March military coup. The updated figure was issued as part of Amnesty International's annual observance of ''Prisoners of Conscience Week.'' The organization said that on April 5, 100 people were killed in Mangal and 35 in Covadonga and that at a village in Quiche Province soldiers gathered all the inhabitants, raped the women, beheaded the men and battered the children to death. In the same province, in May, it said, a house-to-house raid resulted in the deaths of 25 children aged 4 months to 14 years, 3 men and 15 women."
