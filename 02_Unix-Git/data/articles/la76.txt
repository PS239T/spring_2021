"Americas Watch, a New York-based nonprofit organization that reports on human rights conditions in Latin America, said over the weekend that President Reagan should not lift a ban on military sales to Argentina because of that country's poor human rights record. Last Monday, President Reagan lifted the economic sanctions imposed on Argentina at the outbreak of war with Britain over the Falkland Islands. However, a Congressional ban on sales of military equipment remained in place pending a review of the situation in the Falklands and of any progress Argentina has made with human rights. Juan E. Mendez, director of the Washington office of Americas Watch, said Saturday that Argentina had failed to account for the ''thousands of persons who disappeared between 1976 and 1981'' and that numerous human rights violations had occured during and since the war over the Falklands. Americas Watch is affiliated with Helsinki Watch and the Fund for Free Expression."
