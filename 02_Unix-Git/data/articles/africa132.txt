"The Security Council decided today to postpone for one week a vote to set up an international tribunal to try those accused of genocide and other serious crimes in Rwanda, Sir David Hannay of Britain, the council President, said. A senior United Nations legal official will fly to Kigali to confer with the Rwandan Government, which has some concerns about the way the court would function, Sir David told reporters. Since the tribunal would not be able to try all the cases and many would have to be heard by Rwandan courts, ""there has been concern expressed that there might somehow be a mismatch between the activities of the Rwandan courts and the international tribunal,"" he said. ""There are also many concerns about the desirability of the tribunal conducting a lot of its business, if not all of it, in Rwanda, so that justice could not only be done but be seen to be done, and be seen by the people of Rwanda to be being done."" Sir David said that one concern was the fact that the international tribunal would not have the power to impose the death penalty while Rwandan law did provide for capital punishment. Between 500,000 and one million people, mainly members of Rwanda's Tutsi minority and opponents of the former Hutu-led Government, are estimated to have been killed over the past six months."
