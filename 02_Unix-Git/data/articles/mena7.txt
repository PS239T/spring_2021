"A group of human rights activists, including former diplomats and lawyers, have formed an organization to publicize charges of human rights violations in Iran. The new group, the International Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Iran, will ask the United Nations to investigate allegations of rights abuses and will try to hold ''public hearings'' on conditions in Iran. The formation of the group was announced today in New York and Geneva. ''None of us can be silent in the face of the continuing reports of arbitrary executions, torture and destruction of individual rights as reported from Iran,'' said the group's spokesman, William J.  vanden Heuvel."
