"The South African security police have beaten young people who have been detained under the Government's emergency decree, according to officials of the human rights group Amnesty International. Spokesmen in London and New York say they have documented about 10 cases of physical abuse of young people, including one case in which prison guards in Durban beat a teen-ager and then placed a rubber mask over his face during an interrogation. The youths were detained late last month in black townships in the southeastern province of Natal and in the Orange Free State, the group said. It said a 16-year-old Durban girl, Barbra S. Mkame, was picked up last month for wearing a T-shirt commemorating the 1976 Soweto uprising and was ''severely beaten'' during her detention at Westville prison. Miss Mkame's grandmother sought and was granted a restraining order against the police after visiting her granddaughter at the prison last week, the group said. In Johannesburg, meanwhile, an American Lutheran missionary couple promised to defy a Government-ordered expulsion. The couple, the Revs. Brian and Susan Burchfield, of Lynnwood, Wash., were served with deportation papers on Saturday. They have been working in a mixed-race church in Cape Town since January."
