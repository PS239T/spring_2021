"To the Editor: For Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra to contend (letter, Dec. 9) that ""pluralist democracy is alive and well in Algeria"" is outrageous. Contrary to his contentions, it is pluralist death that is ""alive and well"" in Algeria. More than 50,000 people were killed in Algeria in the past five years. They were not all killed by the armed militant groups. Killings and abuses have been carried out in the name of the Government's ""anti-terrorist fight."" At the end of 1994, a Ministry of Interior source gave a figure of 20,000 ""terrorists"" killed in the previous two years. Thousands of extrajudicial executions have been documented in the past few years. Despite government claims, not a single case of extrajudicial execution, torture, ill treatment or disappearance perpetrated by members of the security forces is known to have been independently investigated. Tens of thousands of those killed were civilians. ABDELAZIZ ABDELAZIZ Amnesty International USA Middle East Coordination Group Washington, Dec. 9, 1996"
