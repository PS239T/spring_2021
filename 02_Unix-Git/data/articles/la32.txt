"The Reagan Administration, easing human rights restrictions on military aid to Guatemala, has issued an export license for jeeps and trucks valued at $3.1 million for the Guatemalan army. The export of this military equipment was facilitated by a State Department decision to shift ''military vehicles'' from a restricted list, which bars the sale of such equipment to countries considered serious violators of human rights under the Foreign Assistance Act. During the Carter Administration, Guatemala's military regime halted attempts to purchase United States equipment after the State Department reported to Congress that Guatemala's security forces were conducting ''systematic violation of human rights.''"
