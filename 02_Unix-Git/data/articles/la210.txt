"A Government prosecutor said today that he would appeal a civilian court's decision this month to acquit four former military rulers on charges of extensive human rights abuses. The prosecutor, Julio Strassera, said he would also ask the court to reconsider the sentences of three officers who received prison terms ranging from 4 1/2 to 17 years. Mr. Strassera said in a telephone interview that these penalties were too light. The lawyers for all five defendants found guilty will also appeal by Tuesday's deadline, according to court sources. Mr. Strassera's appeals come two weeks after a civilian court handed down its verdict in the trial of nine former military rulers charged with responsibility for the murder, torture and kidnapping of more than 9,000 people."
