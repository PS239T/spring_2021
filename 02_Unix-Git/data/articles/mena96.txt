"The Israeli police, in an unusual action against Jewish critics of the Government's human-rights record, have closed the offices of a Jerusalem information agency sympathetic to Palestinians and arrested four workers. The private agency, the Alternative Information Center, was ordered closed for six months after a raid by the police, who charged that it was ''rendering services'' to a Palestinian terrorist organization. The center supports Palestinian nationalism and provides regular reports of what it says are human-rights abuses in the Israeli-occupied territories. Although the Government in the past has closed several Palestinian-run information and press agencies in the occupied territories, The Jerusalem Post described the closing of the Alternative Information Center and arrest of the Jewish and Arab staff on Monday as the first such crackdown in Jerusalem. The police said investigators had found evidence that activities on behalf of the outlawed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were being carried out at the center. Lea Tsemel, a lawyer who is married to the center's director, Michel Warshawsky, said the center was not in collusion with the Popular Front and did not keep track of who uses its services."
