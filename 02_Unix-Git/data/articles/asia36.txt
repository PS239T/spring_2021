"Sarah Caldwell, the artistic director of the Opera Company of Boston, said today this would be a world without music if artists denied their music to every country supposed to have human rights problems. Speaking at a news conference, Miss Caldwell defended her decision to help establish an opera company in Manila under an agreement with this nation's First Lady, Imelda R. Marcos, who is chairman of the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Some human rights activists have criticized the link, saying it would lend an aura of glamour and credibility to the regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Amnesty International has accused the regime of widespread human rights abuses. President Marcos, who lifted eight years of martial law two years ago, has denied the allegations. Miss Caldwell said she was aware of the criticisms of Philippine conditions, and of conditions elsewhere in the world, and that she thought people who had criticized the opera agreement were sincere. But, she added: ''If one were to say that one cannot perform music in a country because it has not solved all its problems, you'd be hard put to find any place where one could perform music. You would not be having much music in this world. I think that's unthinkable.'' She said she considers the Opera Company of the Philippines, formally launched today, important and that it could help develop the talents of Filipino artists and composers and promote love for opera in the country. The five-year link with the Opera Company of Boston involves staging local productions, training Filipino artists and internships with counterparts in Boston."
