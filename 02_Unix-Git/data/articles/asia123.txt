"The Chinese Government responded angrily today to accusations from Amnesty International that it had ordered secret executions of dissidents and imprisoned more than 10,000 people involved in the crushed democracy movement. Officials here charged that the report was ''entirely ungrounded and unreasonable'' and said that both the human-rights organization and the United States were interfering in China's internal affairs. In the first regularly scheduled press briefing since the democracy movement was suppressed in June, the Government's chief spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, said continued American sanctions were ''infringing on China's dignity.'' Spoke Prior to U.N. Vote Mr. Li's comments were made before a United Nations subcommission on human rights in Geneva voted today to criticize China for recent events and their ''consequences in the field of human rights.'' The Amnesty International report that China rejected today included references to a secret directive circulating within the Chinese Government to sentence the most active ''counterrevolutionaries'' to death and to imprison many others, but not to make public the full extent of the actions. It maintained that security forces killed at least 1,000 civilians when they retook Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 4 and that 300 more were killed in Chengdu in southern China. Mr. Li said today that Amnesty International's charges were ''entirely ungrounded and unreasonable.''"
