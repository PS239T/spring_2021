"To the Editor: After a spate of quite uncritical reporting on the actions of the military government in Turkey, it is encouraging to see hints of a more balanced attitude in Marvine Howe's news stories of March 16-17. I would hope that the widespread public concern in Europe over the conditions in Turkey would finally begin to spill over to this side of the Atlantic, too. he situation in Turkey follows the well-known pattern of human rights violations: The existence of over 35,000 political detainees (official figure) added to a similar number held during the martial law period before the coup; the systematic use of torture in prisons; the frequently fatal search-and-destroy operations undertaken by the security forces, and the total ban on political activities have already been publicized. What is perhaps less tangible but equally disturbing, however, is the atmosphere of political apathy and psychological terror that the military government seems to be cultivating through a variety of means. The apparent goal of eradicating political violence seems to have turned into a pretext for the frustration of the booming trend toward intellectual and political diversification that went a long way toward creating the beginnings of a democratic culture in Turkey during the 60's and 70's. Another point that deserves comment in this respect is the nature of the ''democracy'' the current regime promises to install after having pacified the country. The constitutional and statutory provisions reportedly being considered by the national security council, in fact, do not leave much room for optimism as far as democracy is concerned. These include, inter alia, a series of measures aimed at significantly increasing the powers of the execu-tive vis-a-vis the Parliament; at re-ducing the independence of the judiciary and effectively abolishing judicial overview of legislation and administration; the creation of a State Security Court directly answerable to the executive with virtually unchecked powers over political cases; the abolition of the autonomy of elected town and city administrations; the subjection of university appointments and dismissals to executive control; the banning of political activities of labor unions and professional associations; the adoption of measures securing the elimination of political organizations outside the two major ''centrist'' parties, and the reduction of rank-andfile influence within the political parties. Given the almost total silence of political opposition within Turkey, critical international opinion may be the only effective lever against the wholesale incorporation of such measures in the new constitution.
