"  The army said today that 19 soldiers had been killed and eight wounded in a guerrilla ambush in the north. The insurgents were said to have set off two mines near a patrol on guard duty, then opened fire with rifles.  The announcement of the ambush, which occurred Monday at Sayaxche, 260 miles north of here, made no mention of guerrilla casualties.  Meanwhile, the Government denied accusations by Amnesty International that torture, mutilation and mass executions have been common since the March 23 coup that brought Gen. Efrain Rios Montt to power. The rights group said Monday that 2,600 peasants had been killed by army and militia units in at least 112 operations between March and July."
