"''Prayer is our greatest weapon,'' the Wycliffe Bible Translators said after one of their number, Chester A. Bitterman, was kidnapped by leftist guerrillas in Bogota on Jan. 19. The California-based missionary group refused demands that its local affiliate leave Colombia, and yesterday, after several of their ''deadlines'' had passed, the kidnappers killed Mr. Bitterman and left his body in a stolen bus on a Bogota street. The killers, who said they belonged to the leftist M-19 movement but have been disavowed by other members of the group, threatened the same fate for Mr. Bitterman's colleagues in the Summer Institute of Linguistics, which they alleged is a front for the United States Central Intelligence Agency. The institute has denied the charge. It said Mr. Bitterman was trying to devise a written language for primitive Colombian Indians and to produce Bible translations. Mr. Bitterman's death coincided with the release of six targets of Government repression in Argentina. The six, monitors of Argentine human rights abuses, were arrested last weekend on charges of violating national security laws. Their leader, Emilio Mignone, had just returned from testifying before a United Nations panel in Geneva about the 6,000 Argentines who have ''disappeared'' in Government or paramilitary custody since 1976; Mr. Mignone's daughter is among those who vanished. The Reagan Administration, which has so far reserved public criticism of human rights abuses to Communist regimes, did not comment on the arrests, but they provoked a storm of unfavorable editorial opinion toward Argentina in the United States and elsewhere in the hemisphere. International protests were also raised over the arrest of the head of the human rights commission in Nicaragua, who had accused the Sandinist Government of ''torture and repression very similar'' to that of the ousted Somoza regime. The man was released after issuing a statement that he had been ''misinterpreted.''"
