"Without the din around a certain embassy in downtown Teheran, it is now possible to hear some very different cries of complaint there.  This week's came from 38 academics, writers and lawyers who insist on reaffirming the cause of human rights against the Shah's successors. We treasure these samples, particularly since human rights is getting something of a bad name in free places. The 38 charge that Iran's authorities, mostly representing the fundamentalist Islamic Republican Party, hold political prisoners, use torture, deny free expression and assembly, fire workers on ideological grounds and show contempt for learning by closing universities. The protesters say the authorities are manipulating the public, repressing ethnic minorities, fouling up the economy and, in their sterile bickering with other factions, wrecking the revolution. Nor is this the only sign of impatience in the new Iran. Of late, none other than Ayatollah Khomeini has been mixing his denunciations of Western corruption with his own complaints about torture, discord and mismanagement. Indeed, he has called for a sort of separation of church and state, telling lesser mullahs to stay out of daily politics and to take a cue from the type of patriotic collaboration that political rivals exhibit in, yes, the United States. We recommend a further study of some of those captured embassy documents, starting with the Bill of Rights."
