"To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman's sane call for a reappraisal of United States policy toward Iran (column, Sept. 11) is lacking in one important respect. He fails to list Teheran's treatment of its own people among the changes necessary for improving Iran's relations with this country. While the scale of human rights violations may have lessened in recent years, the Iranian Constitution and other applied laws do not provide fundamental human rights safeguards. According to Article 4 of the Iranian Constitution, all laws are secondary to Islam as interpreted by the ruling clerical elite. Competing interpretations of Islam are not tolerated, as the detained followers of Grand Ayatollah Nasser Makaram-Shirazi and Grand Ayatollah Sadeq Rohani can testify. Leaders of minority religious communities remain excluded from political life and face imprisonment or execution. Rights of free assembly have been curtailed through violent attacks by pro-government mobs on opposition gatherings and leaders. Opposition or independent journalists also face prosecution, imprisonment and corporal punishment for exercising their right to free expression. While there is a need for new thinking on United States policy on Iran, this new thinking should not disregard respect for human rights and the rule of law that would transform the behavior of the Iranian authorities, holding them accountable for their action both to their own people as well as to the international community. On this foundation a new relationship with Iran could be built. ELAHE S. HICKS New York, Sept. 16, 1996 The writer is a consultant with Human Rights Watch-Middle East."
