"To the Editor: In your July 19 news article about East Timor, you acknowledge that the area is normally closed to outsiders. Why then did Indonesian authorities permit your reporter and three other Western journalists to spend five days on the island in July? Was it perhaps an attempt to sandbag the Amnesty International campaign on East Timor begun at the end of June? The article acknowledges past brutalities, but minimizes current human-rights abuses. There are ''only 50 political prisoners'' in Comarca Prison in Dili, in addition to the 1,176 detainees you say are on Atauro Island. You quote the Indonesian opinion that the just-released Amnesty International report is based too much on refugee sources and is thus out of date. This seems a rather perverse argument from the very people who for the last decade have done their utmost to deny to Amnesty and to other human-rights investigators any direct sources of information. It also ignores the fact that Amnesty's charges of continuing repression are supported by other, independent witnesses. For example, last year two longtime human-rights activists, Carmel Budiardjo and Liem Soei Liong, both natives of the South Pacific, published their study, ''The War Against East Timor.'' And last January, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Administrator of East Timor, Msgr. Carlos Ximenes Belo, smuggled out a four-page letter in which he accused the Indonesian administration of carrying out mass arrests, summary executions and forced migrations. This letter was reported and quoted in The Washington Post of April 28. You have performed a useful service in reminding the public of the existence of East Timor, and the Indonesian viewpoint certainly deserves to be heard. But please don't neglect equally authoritative information on the continuing tragedy of that island, whose people have already suffered so silently for so long.
