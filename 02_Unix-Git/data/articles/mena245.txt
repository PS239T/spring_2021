"The United Nations Human Rights Commission today condemned the Sudan and Iraq for what it said were widespread executions and terror, and took unusual steps to have the reported atrocities officially investigated. The 53-nation commission, at its annual meeting, voted for the first time to order a public examination of violations in the Sudan. The commission also called for monitors to be deployed in Iraq to check on reports of ""massive violations of the gravest nature."" The commission also voiced concern at reported executions and torture in Iran; agreed to continue monitoring violations in Haiti; expressed concern over reports of torture, executions, forced labor and political arrests in the former Burma, and condemned reported atrocities by Zairian forces loyal to President Mobutu Sese Seko. The panel took no action on a proposal of concern on Chinese rights."
