"Emmanuel Kiwanuka Cardinal Nsubuga, the former head of the Roman Catholic Church in Uganda and an opponent of human rights abuses under the military dictatorship of President Idi Amin, died on Saturday, a church official said today. He was 76 years old. A church spokesman, the Rev. Mukasa Nkeera, said Cardinal Nsubuga had died of blood and bone cancer in a hospital in Cologne, Germany, where he had been admitted on Dec. 5. The prelate, who was ordained in 1947, became the East African nation's sole cardinal in 1976. During General Amin's nine-year rule, Cardinal Nsubuga spoke fearlessly against the Government's human rights abuses. General Amin was overthrown in 1979 by Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles. The Cardinal also encouraged priests and nuns throughout the country to shelter people fleeing harassment by the army during the civil war that later raged during the Government of Milton Obote, who was in turn ousted by the military in August 1985. The Cardinal retired in April 1990."
