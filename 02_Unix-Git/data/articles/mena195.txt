"A newsletter has reported that Alois Brunner, one of the last major Nazi war criminals still sought for prosecution, died several months ago in Syria. The Paris-based publication, Letter from the East, quoted diplomats in Damascus as saying that he died last summer, when he would have been 79 or 80. A report on the article ran today in the newspaper Le Monde. France convicted Mr. Brunner in absentia in 1954 of crimes against humanity and condemned him to death for his role in deporting 120,000 Jews to death camps during World War II. Syria refused to comment on the report of his death."
