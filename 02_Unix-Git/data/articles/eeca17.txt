"It is patently obvious that Claire Sterling's article was designed to advance current American foreign-policy doctrine that the Soviet Union is responsible for '' 'training, funding and equipping' those who kill for political profit.'' In the first place, virtually all of Miss Sterling's sources consist of anti-Soviet government officials and law-enforcement agents and the C.I.A. Secondly, she asserts categorically, and without the slightest proof, that resolutions passed by the delegates to the 1966 Havana Tricontinental Conference calling for close collaboration between ''Socialist countries'' and ''national liberation movements'' were nothing more than ''a call for a Guerrilla International.'' Thirdly, and most incredibly, she attempts to blame the reigns of terror in Turkey, Northern Ireland and Italy on Soviet instigation. If her purposes were not so diabolic, it would almost be amusing to read her claims that the I.R.A. Provos are, in fact, Marxist revolutionaries and that, despite their bitter condemnation by the Italian Communist Party, the Red Brigades in that country are U.S.S.R. creations. I was somewhat surprised that she did not also condemn the Russians for the domestic and/or international terrorism instigated by Chile, Argentina and the late Shah of Iran, as well as the right-wing Salvadoran death squads.
