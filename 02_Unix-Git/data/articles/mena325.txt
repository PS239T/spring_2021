"To the Editor: ""Turkish Court Yields to Police Officers Accused of Torturing 14"" (news article, Oct. 23) notes that Turkish authorities ""concede there have been incidents of torture in detention centers, but insist that they are isolated."" They are not. In 1990 the New York City Bar Association reported on its human rights delegation to Turkey, on which I served, that found that such torture was widespread and that the legal system's response was a failure. A follow-up report last year stated: ""Widespread, systematic torture, particularly against detainees in police custody, is well documented by . . . international governmental associations and the United States Government.""
