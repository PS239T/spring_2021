"The police in Kenya have tortured hundreds of people suspected of opposing the Government during a 16-month-old crackdown on a dissident Marxist group, Amnesty International charged today. The Kenyan Foreign Ministry denied accusations of systematic torture but acknowledged that two policemen have been arrested ''for acts of torture'' and may face prosecution. Amnesty International, an international human rights organization, appealed to the Kenyan Government, led by President Daniel arap Moi, to stop torturing prisoners and assure prompt, fair trials for all detainees. In a 58-page report, it said dozens of people have been jailed for an average of about five years on suspicion of being linked with Mwakenya, a clandestine opposition group, and have been tortured into making false confessions."
