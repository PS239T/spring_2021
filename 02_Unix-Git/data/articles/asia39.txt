"Amnesty International said today that China is holding thousands of political prisoners in jails and labor ''re- education'' camps and has executed thousands of other Chinese in a 13- month-old anticrime campaign. In its first major report on China since 1978, the London-based human rights group said tens of thousands of people were arrested and thousands of others were executed in the first three months of the anticrime drive. The 132-page report said that since 1981, China had nearly doubled - to 44 - the number of crimes punishable by execution. The rights group said it submitted the report - along with appeals for fair trials, an end to the death penalty and release of political prisoners - to the Chinese Government at the beginning of this year but received no reply. The report said some of the prisoners have reportedly been held in solitary confinement for weeks or months and were sometimes manacled. It said Amnesty International was not able to estimate the total number of people arrested or executed in the anticrime drive. But it added: ''During the first three months of the campaign, tens of thousands of arrests and several thousand executions are believed to have been carried out. Amnesty International recorded more than 600 executions in only a few places in China during that period.'' It quoted foreign press reports as estimating that 5,000 executions were carried out in the nation of one billion in the first three months of the campaign. David Laulicht, a spokesman for the group, said Amnesty estimated there were now fewer political prisoners in China than during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in which thousands of intellectuals were killed, jailed or forced into menial jobs."
