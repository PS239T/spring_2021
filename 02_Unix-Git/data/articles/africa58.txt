"In Zimbabwe last week, plainclothes police arrested Michael Auret and Nicholas Ndebele, the chairman and director of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. Their apparent offense was embarrassing Prime Minister Mugabe's regime by passing information used in critical reports by Amnesty International and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. That embarrassment has now been magnified by a reprisal worthy of Ian Smith's white minority regime, whose emergency laws were used in this arrest. The old regime lives on in spirit in the person of Enos Nkala, Home Affairs Minister. Though the supposedly impartial custodian of the law, he is celebrated for his clamorous invective against those who offend his political superiors. He has a way with language. Recently, after accusing church groups of smearing his Government, he added charmingly, ''I might have to hammer them.'' With colleagues like that, Mr. Mugabe need not wonder why Zimbabwe has lost much of its glow."
