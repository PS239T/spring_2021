"A representative of Pope John Paul II hailed Martin Luther today as ''a religious genius'' and suggested that the excommunication of the 16th-century monk by the Roman Catholic Church should be reconsidered. At a service marking the 500th anniversary of Luther's birth, Johannes Cardinal Willebrands lauded his theological contributions and urged reconciliation between Protestants and Catholics. ''Martin Luther not only makes his impact felt in the life of Protestant Christianity,'' Cardinal Willebrands said from the pulpit of the 13th-century St. Thomas Church, where Luther preached in 1539. ''He is also alive in the ecumenical movement.'' Noting that Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X in 1521, Cardinal Willebrands said: ''We have to see the historical facts as they are. But they could also today be seen in one or another way in a different light, and could prove to be open to a deeper and more comprehensive recognition of truth.''"
