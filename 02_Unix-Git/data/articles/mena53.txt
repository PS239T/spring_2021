"Iran Under Khomeini  In the article ''Iran: Five Years of Fanaticism'' (Feb. 12), Terence Smith has accurately portrayed the domestic repression, the numerous executions and the officially sanctioned torture which the Khomeini regime has brought to the Iranian people. I feel strongly, however, that world public opinion must be more attentive to what is, in some ways, the most egregious human-rights problem of all in Iran: the virtual criminalization of the Bahai religious faith. Viewing the Bahais as heretics and as a potential fifth column for the United States or Israel, the Khomeini regime has robbed the Bahais of their rights as citizens in a way sickeningly reminiscent of Nazi Germany's treatment of German Jews before the Holocaust. Official recognition has been denied to Bahai marriages. Bahais have been fired from jobs and denied pensions and social services. Bahai shrines and cemeteries have been desecrated. Bahais have been denied police protection from mob violence, much of it officially inspired, and prominent Bahais have been arrested, charged with such vague offenses as ''crimes against God'' and ''corruption on Earth.'' In August 1983, Iran's prosecutor general publicly declared that ''activities of Bahais are banned in Iran,'' and following this official ban on Bahai religious and institutional activities, the Khomeini regime has intensified its persecution. Remembering earlier examples of religious persecution which found the world silent, it is incumbent upon us to speak out against the Iranian Government's persecution of a vulnerable minority.
