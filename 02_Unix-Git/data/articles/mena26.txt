"Moroccan authorities are holding political prisoners incommunicado for months, even years, and torturing many of them, the human-rights group Amnesty International said today. In a report on a mission to Morocco in February 1981, the Londonbased organization said the Moroccan authorities had failed to account for hundreds of prisoners, some of whom, it said, had died in deplorable conditions. ''A number of blatantly illegal practices, contravening both Moroccan law and the international covenants on human rights which Morocco ratified, have led to serious human rights violations involving the 'disappearance' of large numbers of people and the deaths in custody of others,'' Amnesty International said. It appealed for information on the fate of about 100 members of the armed forces arrested about 10 years ago and convicted of involvement in attempts to assassinate King Hassan II. The group published what it said were letters by prisoners describing the slow deaths of some of these men in a remote, secret jail, where they were said to have been kept constantly in filthy cells, fed on scraps and denied all contact with the outside world."
