"To the Editor: Your March 5 editorial ''Indian Rights, Rediscovered'' mentions Reagan Administration concern about human rights abuses of Miskito Indians in Nicaragua and enumerates others in Latin America. But you need not go so far. In Arizona, the forced migration of 9,000 Navajos is almost complete. It has caused a sharp increase in physical illness, mental illness and death. Also, it has made it impossible for the Navajos to practice their culture. In addition, as the unsuccessful attempt of the Oglala Sioux to regain their Black Hills homeland and many other cases (such as that of the Akwesasne in Upstate New York) show, the courts are being used as a means to implement policy rather than to arrive at justice. The attitude toward American Indians can plainly be seen in a bill recently introduced in Congress which would ''resolve'' all Indian land claims in New York and South Carolina by extinguishing their land rights and by violating ratified treaties. This bill was drafted by Representative Gary Lee, Republican of New York, without consulting the Indians. Add to this the potential impact of the Reagan budget cuts, which threaten to wipe out all the gains of the past 20 years on the Navajo reservation, where the number of unemployed has nearly doubled in the past year and now exceeds 70 percent. If President Reagan really cares about the Indians, he should do what he can to see to it that they are treated with respect. If he wants to show his concern for Indian rights, there is much he can do in his own country. JEROME FRANK, Brooklyn, March 8, 1982"
