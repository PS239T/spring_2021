"President Daniel arap Moi, returning today from official visits to the United States and Britain, strongly denied reports that his Government had committed human rights abuses. Mr. Moi said he held ''successful'' meetings with President Reagan and other senior officials in Washington and with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London. But he was dogged during his trip by press reports charging Kenya with human rights violations in a crackdown on a clandestine group that Mr. Moi has accused of plotting to overthrow his Government. The State Department issued a statement last week expressing concern about the reports and urging Kenya to investigate. Mr. Moi, addressing a crowd of several hundred people at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, made no reference to the State Department call. Instead, he criticized the press reports.  ''There are newspaper writers who have flocked to Nairobi from all over the world,'' he said. ''Instead of respecting our hospitality, they disseminate filthy stories, saying we are persecuting people.'' Mr. Moi denied reports that 300 Kenyans are in detention for political offenses, saying that the true number was only 10 or 11. He said that in 1978, when he became President, he released all 26 political detainees being held at that time. ''After their release, they behaved as in the case of the pig after you have scrubbed it clean of dirt,'' Mr. Moi said. ''It goes straight back to wriggle in the mud.'' ''What do we do? We lock them up. Do you think these are people we expect to have as leaders of the people and trust their leadership? It's impossible.''"
