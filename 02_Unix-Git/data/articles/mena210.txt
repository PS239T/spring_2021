"Iran denied today a role in the Israeli Embassy bombing in Buenos Aires. This is one day after the United States said it had information that Teheran might have been involved; 28 people died in the March 28 raid. In a statement by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, Iran rejected the accusation as ""an unfounded claim and a pure lie."" ""This new U.S. accusation is an attempt by the American policy makers to overshadow their internal crisis, which stems from injustice, racial discrimination and human rights violations in that country."""
