"Amnesty International today appealed to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, to stop what it called liquidation of his opponents. The London-based human rights organization expressed alarm at the execution of seven Libyans between June 3 and 7, saying they ''had all been arbitrarily arrested and hanged publicly withouttrial. The group also said that hundreds of Libyans had been arrested and that some might have been tortured after an attack May 8 on Mr. Qaddafi's headquarters in Tripoli."
