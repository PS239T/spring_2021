"Chile's military chiefs have evidently decided that the Reagan Administration will cause them no trouble on human rights. On Dec.  10, which Mr. Reagan had just joined in proclaiming as Human Rights Day, they arrested at least seven dissidents, including three officers of Chile's Human Rights Commission. Last August, the junta showed comparable brazenness. Jaime Castillo, the commission president, was banished immediately following a visit to Chile by Jeane Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations. Mrs. Kirkpatrick was thus repaid for her call for improved ties with Santiago. The more Chile persists in these jailings and expulsions, the more insulting the implied judgment about Mr. Reagan's backbone. At the United Nations, American delegates have persistently voted against any censure of Chile on grounds that Latin America has been invidiously singled out for censure. But Latin democracies, in making the same point, abstain. And in regional forums like the Organization of American States, Washington has yet to utter a critical peep about Chile, where a return to civilian rule is not even promised before the end of the decade. To be sure, ''quiet'' diplomacy is supposed to produce reforms in anti-Communist tyrannies like Chile. The arrests on Human Rights Day show just what the silent approach truly produces."
