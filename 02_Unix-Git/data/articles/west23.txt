"Three years of tedious diplomacy gave way to less subtle examples of statecraft in Madrid last week, as the conference on East-West Relations in Europe drew fitfully toward a close. While the chief American delegate and his Soviet counterpart swapped acrimony on human rights issues, the island nation of Malta kept everyone from going home by refusing to approve the final document unless it called for a follow-up conference on Mediterranean security. Max M. Kampelman, the American, took the floor to denounce continuing ''repression of human beings in the Soviet Union,'' and Sergei A. Kondrashev, the Russian, responded that Mr. Kampelman's speech was ''unworthy, falacious, injurious.'' The agreement, considered the first significant addendum to the 1975 Helsinki accords that put detente into writing, was considered important to the West in its inclusion of Soviet recognition of some labor organizing and religious freedoms. (Symbolically underlining the latter, a group of 16 Siberian Pentecostals arrived in America last week; Moscow's release of them after 20 years of pleading was considered a nod to Madrid.) For its part, the Soviet Union got approval of a Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament that is scheduled to open in January in Stockholm. The scope of that meeting was broadened to please the West Germans, who sought some discussion of tension-easing measures that would make deployment of new American missiles in Europe more acceptable back home. Such accommodations cut little ice with the International Helsinki Commission, a federation of private citizens groups from Western countries. In a statement, the organization said it was ''deeply distressed'' by continuing human rights abuses in some Soviet bloc countries that signed last week's addendum."
