"An international human rights monitoring group has asked President Reagan, in his meetings with President Suharto and other Indonesian officials, to address human rights issues that include what the group says are the executions without trial of several thousand people suspected of being criminals in recent years. The group, Asia Watch, said the killings are widely believed to be an officially sanctioned method of discouraging crime. In a letter, the group asked President Reagan, who is to arrive in Bali Tuesday, to address rights issues, adding: ''Large segments of Indonesian society are alarmed at what they see as increased government intolerance of dissent.'' In a 30-page report, the group said severe restrictions had been placed on an estimated one and one-half million former political prisoners, most of whom never have been tried or convicted."
