"A United Nations report estimates that there were 9,250 political murders in El Salvador in the first six months of this year, more than the total estimated by the State Department for all of last year. The report, to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, concluded that there has been ''a consistent pattern of gross violations'' of human rights in El Salvador since the ruling junta took over in 1979. The study found more detailed information about abuses by the Government and its rightist supporters than by the armed leftist guerrillas. The report said, however, that it could not ''establish even approximately'' each side's share of the violence. The report also said that the executive and judicial branches of El Salvador's Government ''have adopted a very widespread attitude of passivity and inactivity'' toward the violations. Ernesto Rivas-Gallon, El Salvador's Ambassador to Washington, and Mauricio Rosales-Rivera, the head of El Salvador's United Nations mission, were unavailable for comment. Other Salvadoran officials in Washington and New York, reached by telephone, declined to answer questions about the report. An aide to Mr. Rivas-Gallon suggested the Ambassador might comment on the report later. The 35-page study based its estimate of deaths on reports by Government and private organizations, including Amnesty International and Legal Aid, an office run by the Archdiocese of San Salvador. The report was prepared by Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo, a Spanish human rights advocate who teaches law at the University of Madrid."
