"To the Editor: It is telling that Alfred P. Rubin (letter, July 14) relies only on early 19th-century precedents to support his argument that states do not have, in the absence of a treaty, any criminal jurisdiction over acts occurring outside a state's borders. In fact, it is now generally accepted that states have criminal jurisdiction over actions committed by aliens abroad with respect to the limited category of crimes being prosecuted by the Yugoslav and Rwandan international tribunals -- genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. One of the earliest examples of this principle was the Adolf Eichmann case in Israel. Although some questioned the manner of Eichmann's apprehension, the right of Israel, a country that did not even exist when the crimes alleged were committed, to prosecute and punish Eichmann under the principle of universal jurisdiction was not questioned. In this country, it has been more than 10 years since decisions in the Demjanjuk and Filartiga cases endorsed universal jurisdiction. International law recognizes that individuals who commit acts of genocide should not evade accountability based on attenuated notions of the limits of jurisdiction. The principle of universal jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes is now the norm. DAVID STOELTING New York, July 15, 1996 The writer is a lawyer."
