"Press freedom and India's good name are the beneficiaries of the New Delhi Government's decison not to prosecute Brahma Chellaney. The young Associated Press reporter, an Indian national, was accused of filing false and inflammatory dispatches from the Punjab when Government troops stormed the Golden Temple in June 1984. Mr. Chellaney's only offenses were enterprise and accuracy. He was the only reporter for a foreign news agency in Amritsar, which the Government had closed to the press. His accounts, not distributed in India, estimated the death toll at 1,200, double the official figure. Given lurid rumors of worse massacres, the Government should have recognized the benefit of an independent account. The hesitations in prosecuting Mr. Chellaney suggest that the case against him was nebulous. He was never arrested or formally charged, though he was subjected to intense interrogation. Now the Government lets it be known that it has dropped preliminary charges and restored his press credentials. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has written the right ending to a case he inherited with the Sikh crisis."
