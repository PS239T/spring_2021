"An Ethiopian court described today how Emperor Haile Selassie was ""strangled in his bed most cruelly"" in 1975 by order of the leaders of a Marxist military coup. Judges reading charges of genocide and murder on the second day of trials against 67 former members of the military government of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam said the Emperor's opponents had met on Aug. 23, 1975, ""and with complete premeditation resolved that His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie should be strangled because he was head of the feudal system."" The charges added, ""He was so strangled on Aug. 26, 1975 in his bed most cruelly."" Legend has for years told how the frail, 82-year-old Emperor was suffocated with a pillow by an assassin sent by the military dictatorship in Addis Ababa's Grand Palace after being detained there for a year. But the charges suggested that the execution order was contained in an official document. ""It establishes everything we wanted,"" said Teshome Gabre-Mariam Bokan, lawyer for the royal family and an attorney general in the imperial Government who was imprisoned for eight years. ""We suspected there was evidence for this all along, but we needed to hear it in court."" The slaying of Haile Selassie is just one of more than 2,000 killings and disappearances alleged to have been ordered by the military government, whose members could face the death penalty if found guilty of either genocide or homicide. Colonel Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe as guerrillas closed on Addis Ababa after his Soviet-backed Government collapsed in 1991. He and 20 others are being tried in absentia. Judges are working their way through a 269-page document of charges that records death after death of named victims from the imperial Government and the ""Red Terror"" pogroms against rival Marxist groups. Under Colonel Mengistu, tens of thousands were killed, tortured or imprisoned."
