"The Government said today that it was forming a human rights commission.  The Government said the commission, including the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Public Health and Education, would ''show the world Guatemala respects human rights.'' Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, recently accused the Government of responsibility for the slaying of at least 2,600 people since last March. The commission will conduct studies and publish reports for international organizations ''to show previous reports were lies,'' the Government said. No date has been set for the commission to begin work. Amnesty International and other human rights groups have accused the Government of widespread and systematic human rights violations.  President Efrain Rios Montt has denied the charges and maintained that the majority of the violations were committed by leftist guerrillas."
