"Judith Miller's article ""Syria's Game: Put On a Western Face"" (Jan. 26) makes a reference to the country's Jewish community, noting that Jews, even more than other Syrians, are ""closely monitored"" and that human rights groups have found that ""Jews are unable to travel outside the country as a family."" But the situation of Syria's Jews is far more serious than this. In fact, the Syrian Jewish community is being held hostage. Amnesty International reports that the 4,000 Jews of Syria are victims of intimidation, imprisonment and torture. Syrian police control the purchase, sale and transfer of Jewish property. Jews are forbidden to emigrate, and those traveling outside Syria must leave behind family members and large financial deposits as security for their return. If the Syrian regime is to win the international respectability it seeks, it must begin by lifting the harsh restrictions imposed on the Jews of Syria and permit them to emigrate. SEYMOUR D. REICH Chairman, National Task Force on Syrian Jewry of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations New York, N.Y."
