"To the Editor: In a March 18 letter, the executive director of Freedom House, Leonard Sussman, takes you to task for a March 11 editorial which said that the Reagan Administration should follow up its concerns with abuses against Miskito Indians in Nicaragua by concerning itself also with abuses suffered by Indians elsewhere. Mr. Sussman concludes by accusing you of employing ''the last resort of geopoliticians'' - that is, explaining away a gross violation of human rights by saying that everyone maltreats Indians. I agree with his concern about what happened to the Miskitos, though not necessarily with all details in his letter. Also, I agree with what I take to be his general point: that invoking geopolitical considerations is not an appropriate way of responding to reports of human-rights abuses. It is a point that I thought the editorial under attack also makes because it suggests that concern for Indian rights should be demonstrated evenhandedly, and not only when the U.S.  regards the government engaging in abuses as an enemy. But what is astonishing is that Freedom House, of all organizations, should be saying this about the relationship of geopolitics to human rights. Last fall, it issued a policy statement calling for military aid to the Government of El Salvador. To those who objected that an organization professing concern for human rights should not seek support for a government engaging in such gross abuses, Mr. Sussman cited geopolitical considerations. Perhaps his criticism of The Times reflects a change of view. I hope so. It would be a shame if Freedom House were to continue to seek support for the Government of El Salvador despite its humanrights record while continuing to belabor the Government of Nicaragua because of its human-rights record.
