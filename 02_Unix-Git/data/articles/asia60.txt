"An Amnesty International report on South Korea says that hundreds of people are jailed each year for criticizing the Government and that some are tortured to extract false confessions. In the 109-page report, made public here tonight, the human rights group says that at least 10 political prisoners have been executed in South Korea since 1975 and that at least two are being held under death sentences. In Seoul, a high Government official rejected the charges as ''totally groundless.'' He reiterated the Government's contention that there are no political prisoners in South Korea. The Amnesty International report says some political prisoners have been tortured into confessing to crimes such as trying to overthrow the Government or spying for North Korea. It says their trials ''blatantly violated international standards of fairness.''"
