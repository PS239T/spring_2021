"An appeals court has overturned a court ruling that granted an extradition request for a 62-year-old former Dutch SS officer. The former SS officer, Hauke Bert Pattist, was condemned to life imprisonment in absentia by a Dutch court in 1948; he is accused of having sent many Dutch Jews to concentration camps. The ruling that ordered his extradition on May 11 was believed to be the first in Spain that would have returned someone charged with war crimes to his native country. Mr. Pattist, who runs a language school in the northwestern town of Oviedo, has lived in Spain 32 years and has obtained Spanish nationality. The court verdict nine days ago found that his Spanish citizenship was not ground for refusing the 1979 extradition request. It said that his crimes of ''exceptional cruelty'' amounted to genocide and that his return would be ''a noble act in international relations.'' The reason for overturning the ruling could not be learned, and court officials were not available for comment this afternoon. On his release from jail, Mr. Pattist was quoted as saying, ''It's a long way from here to Holland, and I don't intend to go there until they greet me with flowers.'' MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, May 20 (AP) - A Dutch court today acquitted a former resistance fighter and concentration camp inmate of crimes against humanity and ordered his immediate release. It said there was insufficient evidence that Albert Talens, 63, had killed Jewish inmates of the Kaufbeuren-Riederloh concentration camp in southern Germany at the end of World War II."
