"Zairian police forces arrested a prominent opposition figure in the capital of the African nation during a violent confrontation last Sunday, according to the State Department. Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba, a lawyer and former government official who is now a leader of the main group opposing President Mobutu Sese Seko, was reported to have been apprehended while he was attending a political meeting. Beatrice Russell, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said on Friday that the American Embassy in Zaire ''is inquiring into the conditions of his imprisonment.'' She said, ''We have urged the Government to safeguard his human rights and grant him access to independent visitors.'' Mr. Tshisekedi and others have tried to form a second political party in Zaire, called the Union for Democracy and Social Progress. Authorities considered these actions illegal under Zaire's one-party constitution. Amnesty International said Mr. Tshisekedi ''is reported to have been subjected to severe ill-treatment'' and to have ''urgent need of medical treatment.'' Zaire's official news agency said on Wednesday that Mr. Tshisekedi would undergo psychiatric examination because he was ''behaving in a restless and violent manner, spending all his time abusing rudely President Mobutu Sese Seko.'' The Zairian Mission to the United Nations did not return several telephone calls Friday afternoon asking for information about Mr. Tshisekedi's arrest."
