"In the crude arithmetic of terrorism, two wrongs make a headline. An indifferent world has indeed been reminded of past Turkish crimes against Armenians by a wave of killings morally indistinguishable from the massacres they protest. To that extent, terrorism ''works.'' But the doctrine of collective guilt is pernicious, whether invoked by governments or gunmen. The slaughter of Turkish diplomats by Armenian guerrillas in 1983 is no more rational or justifiable than the slaughter of Armenians by the Ottoman regime in 1915. Murdering people because of their ethnic identity is a crime against all humanity. Nothing can excuse the cowardly planting of a bomb at Orly Airport in Paris, which maimed 55 persons and killed 7. Nor can there be glory or sympathy for five Armenian terrorists who seized the Turkish Embassy in Lisbon, paying with their own lives and killing two innocent people as a ''sacrifice on the altar of freedom.'' These are not political or patriotic but pathological suicides.  When modern Turkey refers to ''alleged'' massacres of Armenians in Turkey during World War I, it ignores a damning abundance of evidence, slanders the dead and offends a proud and long-frustrated nationalism. That is the valid grievance of Armenians around the world. It is their vigil and humanity that the terrorists now dishonor.  It may say a good deal about the motives of the terrorists that they threaten more bloodshed in France because it dares to detain the Orly suspects. For France has risked Turkey's anger with open expressions of sympathy for past Armenian suffering. The same terrorists cannot find even a hostile word for the Soviet Union, which has repressed, among many peoples, a large Armenian minority.  These few fanatics deserve the contempt of all Armenians and their well-wishers."
