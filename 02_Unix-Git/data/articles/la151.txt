"The Senate Intelligence Committee said today that it had found no evidence that United States officials had supported death squads in El Salvador. In a report on a six-month inquiry, the committee said unidentified Salvadorans had supported the killings. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, initiated the inquiry when the Senate passed an amendment in April calling for one. In a secret longer version of the report, the committee said United States intelligence agencies had contacts with right-wing groups involved in death squad activities. But, it added, ''United States Government officials did not themselves become involved in extralegal activities.'' The death squads developed in the 1970's, the committee noted, adding that the present President, Jose Napoleon Duarte, had taken steps ''in achieving an amelioration of death squad activities and other abuses.'' The report said the death squads originated in the Salvadoran security services, including the national police, national guard and treasury police. Without identifying anyone, the report said ''numerous Salvadoran officials in the military and security forces as well as other organizations have been involved in encouraging or conducting death squad activities or other violent human rights abuses.'' In addition, the report said, ''a number of prominent Salvadorans have supported, directed or engaged in death squad activities in addition to having encouraged other violent human-rights abuses.'' Senator Kennedy later said in a statement that the committee's decision not to reveal names ''is a shocking decision and a great disappointment.'' He said one of the reasons for the investigation was to inform people about activities of Salvadorans in the killings."
