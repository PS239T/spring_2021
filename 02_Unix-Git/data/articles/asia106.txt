"The Thai Government and the United Nations Border Relief Operation, which oversees the health and safety of Indochinese civilians in camps along the Thai-Cambodian frontier, have agreed that a security task force accused of human rights violations against refugees will be phased out within a month. The security patrol, a paramilitary organization known as Task Force 80, is to be replaced with a new, specially trained police force to be called the Displaced Persons' Protection Unit, according to diplomats and international agency offcials."
