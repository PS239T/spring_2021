"Haitians are being captured and sold to sugar mills in the Dominican Republic for $3.50, a human rights watchdog group has told a United Nations group working against slavery. The London-based Anti-Slavery Society said allegations of the sale of Haitians continued to be made.  ''A 10-year-old boy was captured and sold to a sugar mill,'' the society said in a report to the nongovernmental United Nations Working Group on Slavery, which began a weeklong meeting here today.  ''Five pesos ($3.50) was reportedly the price of captives last year in the border town of Padernales.''"
