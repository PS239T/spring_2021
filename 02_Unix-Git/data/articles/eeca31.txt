"To the Editor: As one who values and cherishes freedom and liberty, I am distressed and saddened by the Polish Government's suppression of Solidarity and its imposition of martial law, but I am puzzled why the action of the Polish Government in imposing martial law is more repugnant than Ferdinand Marcos's imposing martial law in the Philippines. I was pleased to note that the Polish military Government has been warned by President Reagan and other members of the Administration not to use force against Solidarity or the Polish people - a most commendatory step on our part. But why is the Polish Government's use of force against its people and Solidarity any more repugnant to freedom-loving people than the Argentine Government's jailing and torturing union leaders and its citizens, especially its young people; than the El Salvador military's murdering thousands of Salvadorans; than the Guatemalan Government's murdering its peasants and anyone it deems to be ''subversive''? Murder, torture, political repression and suppression of freedom are exactly that, whether carried out by a Communist or an anti-Communist government. If we as a people professing adherence to democracy and liberty are to be believed, and not dismissed as hypocritical and self-serving, then we must consistently fight and protest every violation of human rights, whenever and wherever they occur, and not just when it suits our political purposes to do so. JOYCE R. FARBER, San Francisco, Dec. 17, 1981"
