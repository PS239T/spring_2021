"Outraged former French Resistance leaders demanded today that the lawyer for Klaus Barbie, the Nazi war criminal, prove assertions that an underground hero killed himself after comrades betrayed him to the Germans. Mr. Barbie is in a prison in Lyons awaiting trial on charges of ''crimes against humanity.'' His lawyer, Jacques Verges, said Saturday that Jean Moulin committed suicide after being arrested on June 21, 1943, when Nazis raided a meeting of underground leaders outside Lyons. He said he would prove the assertion later. Postwar tribunals convicted Mr. Barbie in the death and ordered him executed. France has since abolished the death penalty and he cannot be retried for the same crime. Former Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a Resistance leader, denounced Mr. Verges's assertion as ''abominable.''"
