"The Polish Primate, Jozef Cardinal Glemp, publicly accused the authorities today of abusing human rights, and called for forgiveness from all sides in Poland. He specifically urged an end to police beatings of dissident suspects. Thousands of Roman Catholics packing the streets of Warsaw's Old Town for a traditional Corpus Christi procession applauded Cardinal Glemp when he said there were too many infringements of ''human and civic rights and man's dignity.'' In a clear reference to the banned union Solidarity, Cardinal Glemp said, ''There are still too many people discriminated against for their involvement in and support of trade unions, now officially disapproved.'' ''The beating up of people, especially the young, still continues,'' he said. ''We hope that incidents, like the one which resulted in the death of the young boy Grzegorz, will not be repeated.'' He was referring to the death last month of Grzegorz Przemyk, 19 years old, two days after being picked up by Warsaw police and held for several hours."
