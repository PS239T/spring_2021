"An official from Washington has begun an investigation here into possible connections between a Nazi war criminal and members of United States intelligence agencies. The official, Allan Ryan, from the Justice Department's office of special investigations, is interviewing former Bolivian Government members and others familiar with the activities of Klaus Barbie. Mr.  Barbie was expelled from Bolivia and returned to France in February to face trial on charges of ''crimes against humanity.'' Mr. Barbie, the top Gestapo official in Lyons from 1942 to 1944, was convicted of war crimes in absentia and twice sentenced to death by French courts, but the time limit on those charges has expired. Mr. Ryan, who is expected to remain here for a week, is looking into statements by former United States agents in Europe that American intelligence agencies helped Mr. Barbie escape from France to South America in 1951 because he was providing information on Communist activities. The investigator met on Tuesday with officials of the Bolivian Interior Ministry and was reportedly given information about Mr.  Barbie's ties with the military dictatorships that ruled Bolivia during his stay here. Elections were held last year, and Hernan Siles Zuazo, leader of a center-left coalition, was installed as President in October."
