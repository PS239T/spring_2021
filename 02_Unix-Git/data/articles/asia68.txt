"The Aquino Government announced today that it is investigating reports of mass graves containing the bodies of foes of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos or his allies. Jose Diokno, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights, said his committee had evidence of such mass graves. He declined to describe the evidence. Mr. Diokno said the graves reportedly contained the remains of some of about 500 people believed to have been abducted during Mr. Marcos's rule by the military or by the private troops of provincial commanders. ''We believe most mass graves are near the 'safe houses' where political dissidents were interrogated or tortured,'' he said. ''But we don't know where the safe houses are. Of the five or six hundred people who disappeared, we believe at least 90 percent are dead.'' Although Mr. Marcos has left the Philippines, some military commanders and local warlords have continued the violent practices that helped buttress his regime, Mr. Diokno said. Mr. Diokno was jailed by Mr. Marcos for two years in the early 1970's.Rights Commission to study allegations of human rights abuses under Mr. Marcos and to find ways to deter such abuses."
