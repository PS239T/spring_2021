"To the Editor: ""Mindless Murder in Israel"" (editorial, July 27), your condemnation of the heinous terrorist bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv, would be more credible if you also criticized violence and terrorism by the Israeli Government. The United States media are mostly silent when it comes to condemning Israel for the ""mindless murder"" of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian civilians in Lebanon over the years. Israeli state and settler terrorism have killed more than 30 Lebanese and Palestinian civilians for every Israeli civilian killed by Arab terrorists. The torture of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners since 1967 is also a form of mindless state terrorism. These and other human rights abuses are amply documented -- and reported on your news pages -- by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Israeli human rights groups such as B'Tselem. You note that Palestinian violence creates an ""anti-Palestinian, anti-peace backlash"" among Israelis. Left unsaid is that land and water confiscation, torture, death squads and collective punishment, the use of banned weapons in the bombing of civilians in Lebanon and unrestrained settler terrorist acts against Palestinians create an anti-peace, anti-Israeli backlash among Palestinians. Unless the Israeli Government takes steps to protect the human rights and security of Palestinians comparable to the crackdown by the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat on violence-prone Palestinians, the ""compromise peace"" you refer to will not materialize. Rather, Israel will continue to dominate Palestinians, denying them self-determination and maintaining control of vital Palestinian land and water resources. Such a relationship is unacceptable to even the most moderate Palestinians. EDMUND R. HANAUER Exec. Director, Search for Justice and Equality in Palestine-Israel Framingham, Mass., July 27, 1995"
