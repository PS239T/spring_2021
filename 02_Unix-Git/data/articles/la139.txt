"AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 1 (UPI) - A bomb exploded today in a car parked across the street from the presidential palace, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens more, the police said. President Jean-Claude Duvalier was not in the capital at the time of blast. No group immediately claimed responsibility. The explosion shattered windows in the palace and surrounding buildings, the police and witnesses said.  Mr. Duvalier was celebrating the New Year at his villa in the mountain suburb of Petionville at the time of the blast, government sources said. After the explosion, he canceled his planned attendance at a morning mass celebrating the 180th anniversary of Haitian independence. The city was calm and there was no immediate mention of the blast in the press. Haitian officials routinely refuse to give formal statements on any event unless they get permission from Mr. Duvalier. There has been little organized resistance to the President, but thousands have fled Haiti to escape poverty and political repression. Catholic Layman Is Released PORT-AU-PRINCE, Jan. 1 (AP) - A Haitian lay Roman Catholic leader has been freed after four days' detention, a human rights official said on Friday. The rights official, Gerard Gourgue, who is a lawyer and director of the Haitian League for Human Rights, said that he had made telephone contact with the Catholic layman, Gerald Dunerville, but that Mr. Dunerville had declined to discuss the circumstances of his detention. Mr. Dunerville, arrested on Monday, returned home on Thursday, Mr. Gourgue said. Mr. Gourgue said Sylvio Claude, a dissident, also was returned home on Thursday. Mr. Claude and his daughter, Marie-France, were taken to police headquarters on Tuesday. Mr. Claude and 21 other members of his Christian Democratic Party were released from prison under executive clemency in September. They had been imprisoned in 1981 for sedition and insulting President Jean-Claude Duvalier."
