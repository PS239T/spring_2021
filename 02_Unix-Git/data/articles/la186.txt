"The provisional President of El Salvador said here tonight that human rights violations had subsided in his country and called on Congress not to attach strict conditions to military aid. ''I hope the Government and people of El Salvador will not face collective punishment because of the actions a few fanatics,'' President Alvaro Magana said. He was referring to right-wing death squads whose violence against civilians has led to calls for an end to additional aid to his Government. Speaking at a conference sponsored by the San Antionio Chamber of Commerce and Caribbean-Central American Action, Mr. Magana also rejected a proposal by the exile opposition that called for the establishment of a broad government that would include representatives of the leftist guerrillas."
