"Maurice Papon, once one of France's most prominent civil servants and politicians, discovered last week that the pain of history may subside for a while but never really goes away. After 40 years in high posts, he was indicted in Bordeaux for ''crimes against humanity'' for the part he allegedly played in sending Jewish children to Auschwitz during the Nazi occupation in 1942. Charges that Mr. Papon helped carry out German deportation orders when he ran central government services in the southwest Gironde department coexist with evidence that in the same post, he was active in the resistance movement. On the basis of his resistance record, he was able to go on to a distinguished career, notably as head of the Paris police during the first years of the Fifth Republic and from 1978 to 1981 as Minister of the Budget in the Government of President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. But there is no statute of limitations in France for occupation crimes, either in law or in men's hearts. With anti-Semitism very much a current issue, Mr. Papon finds himself, at the age of 72, plunged backward in time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------"
