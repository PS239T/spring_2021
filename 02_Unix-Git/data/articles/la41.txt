"Amnesty International called on the Government of El Salvador today to protect people on ''an apparent death list'' of 138 names published by the army. The human rights group, which made the appeal in a cable to President Jose Napoleon Duarte, said that the list published this month included priests, university rectors and former members of the Government. Many of those named were believed to be abroad, Amnesty International said, but some were still in the country and all were described by the army as traitors. It said that the Salvadoran armed forces had a long record of summary executions, torture and abductions, and that there was evidence that rightist paramilitary squads were operating with the complicity of the security services."
