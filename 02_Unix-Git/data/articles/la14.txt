"The Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia accused the country's military rulers today of serious human rights violations and said, ''Human dignity and freedom to preach the Gospel face a tough test.'' The Bolivian Bishops Conference reported after a six-day meeting that it had documentary proof of murders, physical and psychological torture, persecution of innocent people, numerous dismissals of workers, expulsions, unwarranted detentions ''and other abuses.'' The pastoral letter, titled ''Dignity and Freedom,'' condemned the July 17 coup that overthrew President Lydia Gueiler Tejada, saying that the democratic order's imperfections were not a reason ''to approve the violence used to interrupt a constitutional process in which radical groups were a nondecisive minority.''"
