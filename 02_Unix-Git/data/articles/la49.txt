"The United States joined Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay today in voting against a resolution authorizing the United Nations Human Rights Commission to continue to give special attention to the human rights situation in Chile. The resolution, proposed by Algeria, Cuba, Mexico and Yugoslavia, was approved 22 to 4, with 17 abstentions. The United States delegate, Michael Novak, explained his vote by asserting that human rights violations under the military junta in Chile were ''by no means unique, either in Latin America, among nations on other continents, or in totalitarian states.'' The United States, Brazil and Uruguay also opposed a one-year extension of the mandate held by Abdoulaye Dieye of Senegal to draft reports on Chile for the United Nations General Assembly and the commission. This vote was 30 to 3, with 10 abstentions."
