"To the Editor: Following widespread condemnation of South Africa in the United States, I await with keen anticipation American criticism of Uganda, where according to the internationally respected civil-rights agency Amnesty International, more than 100,000 people have been killed since the overthrow of the dictator Idi Amin. The U.S. might also condemn Lesotho, where the people have been deprived of elections since 1970. It was then that the present Prime Minister, Chief Jonathan, suspended the constitution because it appeared that the people had voted his government out of office. Then there is Tanzania - a one-party socialist state in economic chaos. There will soon be a new Tanzanian presidential election - with one candidate. From here it looks as if the U.S. does not care about violations of human rights by black-ruled states. Perhaps if the U.S. were to show some appreciation of political realities in the one-party states and military dictatorships of the north, it would find the white South Africans, whose forebears settled not long after the Mayflower sailed, rather more amenable.HUGH G. K. PRICE Derbyshire, England, Aug. 18, 1985"
