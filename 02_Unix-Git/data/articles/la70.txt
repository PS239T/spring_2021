"El Salvador's most active human rights group told President Reagan today that the Salvadoran Government was covering up abuses by the military and rightist groups to insure continued United States aid. In an open letter to President Reagan, the Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid Society said the authorities reported a decrease in political killings during May, June and July but left out details on big increases in August and September. It said 701 killings were reported in August, compared with a monthly average of 309 in the three previous months. In the first half of September, 357 political slayings were reported, it said. The bulletin said two civilians were slain by guerrillas, who also killed 23 soldiers. It blamed Government troops and rightists ''death squads'' for most of the other killings."
