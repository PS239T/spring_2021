"The wife of a leading Soviet human rights activist said today that the authorities had indicated that her husband was en route to Siberia to serve the second part of his 12-year sentence, a 5-year term of ''internal exile.'' A Western diplomat, quoting dissident sources here, reported Thursday that the activist, Yuri F. Orlov, had left a labor camp in the Urals after 7 years and was headed for internal exile, but it was not known where he was being sent. His wife, Irina V. Orlova, said she received a telegram on Feb. 9 from the labor camp saying, ''Your husband left 6 February for the custody of the M.V.D. of the Yakutsk A.S.S.R.'' M.V.D. are the Russian initials for Ministry of Internal Affairs, which oversees the police and penal institutions, and Yakutsk is a vast ''autonomous republic'' in eastern Siberia. Mrs. Orlov said she had no idea where Mr. Orlov was headed. Mr. Orlov, 59 years old, a physicist, was founder and leader of the Moscow Group to Promote Observance of the Helsinki Agreements in the U.S.S.R., which was formed to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975 accords. The group issued a stream of detailed reports of human rights violations in the Soviet Union. On Feb. 10, 1977, within nine months of the group's founding, Mr. Orlov was arrested."
