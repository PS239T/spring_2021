"A New York-based human rights group has called on civilian leaders in El Salvador to take greater control over the military in order to win its war against insurgent guerrilla forces. The group, Freedom House, urged in a report last week that the United States continue to give economic and military aid to the Salvadoran Government, but recommended aid be channeled through civilian agencies rather than the military. It said President Jose Napoleon Duarte must be a ''civilian executive, with genuine authority over all the civilian and military elements of the society.'' Specifically, the report suggested that the National Guard, the National Police and the Treasury Police, groups ''notoriously associated with human rights violations,'' be separated from the armed forces and placed under civilian control. ''El Salvador must be civilianized,'' the report said. ''Then and only then, in our view, can the military be professionalized, removed from the suspicion that it coddles rightist death squads, and freed to concentrate on subduing or eliminating the leftist death squads.'' The report asserted that millions of dollars of United States assistance currently supports the military domination of the Government. ''The military is used as a conduit for everything from distributing food to administering the program for displaced persons,'' the report said."
