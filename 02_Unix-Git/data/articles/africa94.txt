"Ryszard Kapuscinski's article, ''Uganda: After the Terror'' (March 12), is a devastating portrait of the legacy of killing, torture, looting and harassment that took place during the regimes of Milton Obote and Idi Amin. When the current Government assumed power under President Yoweri Museveni in 1986, there was an immediate end to the gross human-rights violations inflicted by the previous Governments. However, in a recently published document, ''Uganda: The Human Rights Record, 1986-1989,'' Amnesty International notes increasing reports of unlawful killings of civilians and prisoners and the use of torture by the army and intelligence organizations, especially in northern and eastern Uganda, where there has been conflict between the National Resistance Army and armed rebels. The National Resistance Army has illegally arrested people in areas of conflict, merely on suspicion that they are rebels or rebel supporters. Amnesty International has also received reports of troops in the Gulu district destroying huts and granaries - ostensibly to stop them from falling into rebel hands - and in the process burning civilians to death. Although soldiers in the National Resistance Army have been disciplined for harassment, robbery or murder of civilians, the authorities appear to be much less ready to prosecute soldiers for abuses carried out during military operations in combat areas, precisely where the most serious human rights abuses have taken place.
