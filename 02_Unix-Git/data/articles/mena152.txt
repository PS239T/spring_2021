"Amnesty International said today that it had received reports that Iraqi forces in Kuwait had arrested hundreds of Iraqi exiles opposed to the Government of Saddam Hussein. ''Reports suggest that some of them have already been taken back to Iraq, where they face certain imprisonment and risk torture and, in some cases, execution,'' said the human rights group, which is based in London said. The organization did not disclose the source of its information but said it had reports that Iraqi security forces made the arrests after house-to-house searches in a predominantly Shiite Muslim district in Kuwait City. ''Those arrested apparently include members or supporters of the Iraqi Communist Party and Shiite Muslims with links to the opposition group al-Dawa al-Islamiyya, membership of which is a capital offense in Iraq,'' it said."
