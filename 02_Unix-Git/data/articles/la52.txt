"The Nicaraguan Government ordered the temporary closure of the local Human Rights Commission last night, charging that its director, Jose Esteban Gonzalez, had embarked on a campaign of defamation against the Sandinist regime. The offices of the commission in downtown Managua were sealed off by soldiers this morning and the Ministry of Justice ordered that its archives be confiscated until it had demonstrated that it was acting within the law. Officials were infuriated by statements made by Mr. Gonzalez in Rome last week after a brief audience with Pope John Paul II in which he asserted that ''the Sandinist regime applies methods of torture and repression very similar to those prevailing during the Somoza dictatorship.'' He also charged that about 8,000 political prisoners were being held in Nicaragua today and that 800 people had ''disappeared.'' Rafael Cordova Rivas, a non-Sandinist member of the governing junta, said that Mr. Gonzalez had ''openly lied''in Rome."
