"To the Editor:  Ambassador Sukru Elekdag (letters, Nov. 23) correctly states that the Turkish Constitution prohibits human-rights abuses. So do most constitutions. What the Ambassador omits is that in 34 Turkish provinces the Constitution is suspended. These provinces are under martial law. They include virtually all major cities. There, contrary to the Constitution, prisoners may be and frequently are held incommunicado for up to 45 days. That is when the torture is inflicted, day after day.  It is a fact that some Turkish torturers have been prosecuted. It is not a fact, as the Ambassador alleges, that his Government investigates ''every claim brought to its attention.'' Many detailed cases brought to the attention of the Turkish Government by Amnesty International in particular have received no response.  The Ambassador's suggestion that human-rights groups, presumably including Amnesty International, have joined a cabal to attack Turkey is unfounded. It is unfortunate that he is able to quote a State Department official to this effect. The truth remains: torture will not be stopped by attacking the integrity and distorting the information of those who report it. Torture will stop when the truth of it is told and governments honor the high commitments in their constitutions.  Every step Turkey takes in that direction, such as an end to incommunicado detention, will be welcomed by the world human-rights community. JAMES DAVID BARBER Chairman of the Board Amnesty International U.S.A.  New York, Nov. 26, 1984"
