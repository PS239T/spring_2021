"A court today imposed a death sentence in absentia on the deposed President, Ali Nasser Mohammed al-Hassani, on charges of treason. Death sentences were also imposed on 34 followers, 18 of them fugitives, after a mass trial of 107 of Mr. Hassani's supporters. Mr. Hassani and 43 followers fled to neighboring Yemen during more than a week of bloody clashes that erupted in January 1986 between factions of the ruling Yemeni Socialist Party. The court said that 4,300 people had been killed in the clashes. Mr. Hassani had been making efforts toward reconciliation with his more conservative neighbors, Yemen, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and opening his country to Western investment. After he fled, the official radio accused him of trying to ''link the country with the wheels of neo-colonialism and reactionary influence.'' Air Force Chief Sentenced Among those in court and sentenced to death were the former air force chief, Ahmed Hussein Mussa, and Mubarak Salem, who had been in charge of Mr. Hassani's personal safety. The former navy chief, Abdullah Ahmed al-Husseini, was among those sentenced to death in absentia. Other defendants received jail terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. It was not known when the death sentences would be carried out. The court's ruling still must be ratified by President Haider Abu Bakr al-Attas. Several Southern Yemeni officials have defected to Yemen in recent weeks to protest the trial, which started a year ago. Amnesty International, the human rights organization, expressed concern in its 1987 survey about reports that political prisoners had been tortured to death in Southern Yemen. The survey reported disappearances and extra-judicial executions and said that reporters, trade unionists and former officials were being held without trial for their political beliefs."
