"Amnesty International, the rights group, said early today that political detainees were being ill-treated in Spain. It issued a report saying that it had medical evidence, based on interviews by an Amnesty mission in October 1979, of ''maltreatment amounting to torture inflicted on political detainees held incommunicado in Spanish police stations.'' Amnesty said it recognized that the rights situation had improved since the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, but it added that it was hearing of abuse similar to that found in 1979. Referring to 14 people interviewed in Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao, it said: ''They had been held incommunicado for up to 10 days, subjected to exhausting interrogation and beatings, hung upside down on a bar and given electric shocks or other forms of maltreatment.'' The report cited the case of Jose Luis Delpech Valle, 19 years old, who was taken in handcuffs to a hospital near Barcelona after having suffered a double fracture of the jaw within 15 hours of arrest. He told Amnesty that he had been been beaten, kicked, stripped naked and offered a rope so that he could commit suicide in his cell."
