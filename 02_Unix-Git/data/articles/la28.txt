"To the Editor: William Safire is perfectly correct in saying that one can differ with Jacobo Timerman's views on American foreign policy vis-a-vis the Argentine Government and still admire the man (column June 22).  Decent and intelligent people will differ at times on how best to combat the scourges of government repression, torture, political violence, racism and anti-Semitism. But by trying to use the ''Timerman issue'' to advance his own foreign policy views, Mr.  Safire exhibits the same tunnel vision that he condemns in left-wing ideologues, who, he suggests, ''use Mr. Timerman as their political shield.'' As a non-ideologue, I'd like to know where is it written that U.S.  policy makers must accept the Hobson's choice offered alternately by people like Mr. Safire on the political right and the apologists of the Vietnamese regime on the political left. Why is right- or leftwing repression any more acceptable than the other? Are the 10,000 or so desaparecidos of Argentina (probably moridos) any freer than the vociferous Solidarity trade unionists of Communist Poland? Are Cubans thrown into Castro's jails simply because they are homosexuals any less repressed than the Buddhists in the tiger cages on Con Son Island? ''The Real Timerman Issue'' is not, as Mr. Safire contends, that we have no choice but to support repressive right-wing dictatorships so as to ''resist Communist expansionism'' but that our very support of repressive dictatorships makes the advent of repressive Sovietsupported regimes all the more likely. A more intelligent and unhypocritical foreign policy would be to condemn and work against repression of both right- and left-wing dictatorships with equal ardor, and to support the forces everywhere that promote the ideal of liberty and justice for all.
