"To the Editor: In ""Somalia: Learn from Cambodia"" (editorial, Sept. 30), you praise the United Nations peacekeeping and election-supervising mission in Cambodia because it used ""diplomatic pressure to curb human rights abuses."" You suggest this approach would be effective in Somalia, specifically as an alternative to prosecuting those responsible for attacking United Nations peacekeepers. But in Cambodia, the diplomatic approach of the United Nations involved a substantial failure to control human rights abuses leading up to last May's elections, including political and ethnic killings, arbitrary detentions and the intimidation and harassment of potential voters. The continuing failure of the United Nations to hold abusers accountable in Cambodia is one of the mission's gravest shortcomings. Accountability is no luxury, to be deferred to an ideal moment; it is the cornerstone of a society ruled by laws, respect for which is crucial to stability and to avoiding human rights disasters in the future. By the same token, to abandon the effort to prosecute those who attack United Nations peacekeeping troops in Somalia is to disregard the effects of impunity. You contend that pursuing prosecutions would lead to military confrontation; but without accountability, Somalia cannot rebuild. Indeed, the United Nations mission is faulted by many Somalis for not applying the principle of accountability across the board to the point of excluding from Somalia's future those criminals most responsible for mass starvation and killings between 1990 and 1992. Not only those who attack the United Nations troops, but also the warlords themselves, who have authorized murder, rape and tactics that deprive the population of food, should be brought to account.
