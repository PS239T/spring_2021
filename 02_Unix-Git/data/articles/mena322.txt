"To the Editor: The crisis over Iraq's refusal to lift its ban on American participation on United Nations arms inspection teams stems directly from the Clinton Administration's lack of a tenable policy on Iraq (editorial, Nov. 7). The Administration has failed to stand up to challenges by President Saddam Hussein, culminating in the abandonment of the Kurdish safe haven after Iraq's invasion last fall. Further military action or sanctions will be useless. The United States must take steps to remove Mr. Hussein. A good first move would be to indict him for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. This should be followed by support for the democratic Iraqi opposition, working from its base in northern Iraq to oust the regime and establish a government that respects democracy, human rights and international law. AHMAD CHALABI President, Executive Council Iraqi National Congress London, Nov. 7, 1997"
