"The Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld was expelled from Syria today after her arrest for protesting what she said was the harboring of a Nazi war criminal, according to a report by the French Foreign Ministry. Mrs. Klarsfeld was held briefly in Damascus, then released, after demonstrating in front of the Syrian Interior Ministry. She was protesting the presence in Syria of Alois Brunner, former chief of a transit camp in Drancy, France, who was convicted in absentia for crimes against humanity for his role in deporting 120,000 Jews during World War II."
