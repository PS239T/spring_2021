"More than 2,000 people, mostly Palestinians, have been rounded up by the Kuwaiti military since the Iraqis were driven from this country, detained, tortured and in several cases summarily executed, according to a report from a human rights organization. The preliminary report, on a 12-day study done by Middle East Watch, an affiliate of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said there was growing evidence of human-rights violations, particularly among the large Palestinian population in the capital. Andrew Whitley, executive director of Middle East Watch, said that since the United States and its allies drove Iraqi forces from the country, there had been indiscriminate roundups of suspected Iraqi collaborators. Those who were released described tortures including burning with cigarettes and cutting of slogans into the skin, according to the report."
