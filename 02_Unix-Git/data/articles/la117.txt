"Nicaragua's independent human rights commission has criticized the Sandinista Government's assertions that the nation's problems stem from United States-inspired aggression. In a statement Friday, the Permanent Human Rights Commission ridiculed Sandinista calls for direct talks with the Reagan Administration to negotiate an end to rebel hostilities, saying ''establishing a dialogue with the United States will not resolve the real problem, which is internal.'' It added that ''it is with the Nicaraguans'' that the Government ''has to hold a dialogue, and listen respectfully.'' ''To resolve Nicaragua's problems it is necessary to respect human rights and establish a state of law,'' it said. The statement, which was addressed to the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front, gave no specifics on human rights violations, but said, ''Many Nicaraguans have abandoned the country convinced that in Nicaragua their rights as citizens are not respected and that political, economic, educational and social systems are being imposed on them by force.''"
