"The Afghan Foreign Minister said today that a special United Nations representative would be allowed into the country for the first time to examine charges of human rights violations. In a speech to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Foreign Minister Abdul Walik said the United Nations could send Felix Ermacora to Afghanistan. Mr. Ermacora relied on refugees and other outside sources to compile the latest United Nations human rights report on Afghanistan. It said the Goverment's cease-fire and ''national reconciliation'' effort had had little effect."
