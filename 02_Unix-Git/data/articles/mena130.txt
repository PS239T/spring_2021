"When a worried Iraq sought Western intervention against an intolerant, revolutionary Iran, it advertised itself as a moderate, civilized society. The West stepped in, for its own good reasons, but few were fooled by the Iraqi masquerade. Saddam Hussein's Baghdad dictatorship is one of the world's most barbaric tyrannies. The point is grimly driven home by a new Amnesty International report, which charges that Iraq has for years targeted the children of political opponents to obtain information and to force confessions from their parents. One released prisoner said Iraqi police did this to his family to persuade him to talk: ''Mother, three sisters and three brothers with five children between 5 and 13 were arrested and brought in front of me. They were subjected to beatings on the soles of the feet and electric shocks.'' In 1983, 8,000 males in one Kurdish village, including 315 children, were reportedly driven away in trucks. All vanished and left no trace. Recall, also, that Iraq first used chemical weapons in its war with Iran, then last year gassed its own Kurdish citizens as well, driving thousands across the border into Turkey. In its contempt for human life and pain, secular Iraq seems indistinguishable from fundamentalist Iran."
