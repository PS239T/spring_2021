"The Parliamentary Assembly of the 21-nation Council of Europe rejected efforts today to expel Turkey from the organization, but passed a tough resolution that could ultimately have the same effect. The resolution accused the Turkish military junta of human rights violations, including the torturing of political prisoners. The resolution changed council procedures to allow members to call Turkey to account before the body to answer charges that it violated human rights. It was reported that a Scandinavian country said it was prepared to bring charges against Turkey, forcing the Ankara Government to submit to a review of its practices or leave the council. The resolution was passed as the Assembly's 163 members ended a debate on the political situation in Turkey 16 months after the military seized power from a civilian Government. The Council of Europe, an advisory body, has no power to force members to adhere to its recommendations."
