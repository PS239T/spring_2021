"  The humble billboard, long a medium for domestic politics, is being used by international protest movements trying to gain attention in Washington. As part of a campaign to investigate purported human rights violations in Sri Lanka, Amnesty International has installed 11 billboards around Washington with red and black letters reading ''Sri Lanka - Stop Torture'' and giving the organization's local telephone number. A spokesman said the group was trying to arouse concern in government leaders and influential citizens over hundreds of ''disappearances'' of people seized by security forces in Sri Lanka in two years."
