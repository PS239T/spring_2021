"The Reagan Administration defended the Turkish military junta today against West European criticism of human rights abuses in Turkey. ''While there are human rights problems in Turkey, it would be shortsighted to forget that the current Government has nearly eliminated the human rights violations due to terrorism that were rapidly eroding the viability of democracy in Turkey,'' the State Department said. Reports of torture continue, the department added, but Ankara has punished many offenders and the present regime ''is the first Turkish Government to move vigorously against this problem.'' The department commented on a July 1 application filed with the European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg about the human rights situation in Turkey by Sweden, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway. The application, which could open the way to international discussion, expressed concern the basic principles of the European Convention on Human Rights were not being satisfactorily applied by Turkey."
