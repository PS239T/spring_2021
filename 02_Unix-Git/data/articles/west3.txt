"To the Editor: Paul O'Dwyer is quite wrong when he states (letter Nov. 10) that ''nobody from the outside ... gets inside'' the Maze or Armagh Prisons (in Northern Ireland). v.NEW-TV (Channel 5) recently filmed inside the Maze, and its reports were televised on Nov. 5, 6 and 7. Among numerous church visitors of different denominations, Cardinal O'Fiaich and Bishop Butler of Connor have been there several times in the last year.  There have been various parliamentary delegations (every political party represented at Westminster may send a delegation each year to each prison). Representatives from the British, Irish and American press have included the editor of the Dublin Irish Press, and, of course, members of the independent, nonsectarian Board of Visitors have free access at all times to all parts of the prisons. Equally inaccurate is Mr. O'Dwyer's statement about the European Court of Human Rights, which has never found Britain guilty of torture and has never investigated nor issued a report on the Maze.  However, the European Commission on Human Rights did issue a decision last June rejecting as inadmissible complaints by four protesting prisoners about their treatment and status. Nor has Amnesty International alleged torture in the Maze. On the contrary, its latest report states (page 145): ''Amnesty International does not support the demand for a special status for any prisoner.'' P. M.
