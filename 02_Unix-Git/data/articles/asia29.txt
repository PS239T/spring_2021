"Indonesia's death squads may have killed up to 4,000 suspected criminals in a drive against crime in the last nine months, the country's leading human rights activist said today. The activist, Adnan Buyung Nasution, a former public prosecutor and founder of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute, accused the Government of carrying out the killings and challenged President Suharto to intervene to stop them. ''We can say without hesitation that they are done by the Government apparatus, by the armed forces - in this case, the military and the police in a combined operation,'' he said. ''They call it a special task force.'' Asked how many suspected criminals had died in the campaign, he said the figure was probably close to double the estimate of 2,000 disclosed by the Legal Aid Institute last month."
