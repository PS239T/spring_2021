"To the Editor: As a member of Amnesty International, I am opposed to the death penalty, but I am even more opposed to the execution of people who were minors at the time of the crime. I have just written a letter to the President of Pakistan and to his Prime Minister, objecting to the execution of a young man who was 12 when a robbery was committed in which he was found by the court to be involved. I felt rather ashamed to have to admit in my letter that this happens in our country too. The United States case I have in mind at the moment is that of William Wayne Thompson, who is on death row in Oklahoma. No one seems to doubt that he was involved, along with three adults - one of them his 27-year-old brother. But the execution of individuals who were younger than 18 at the time of a crime is not done in civilized society. Like some other international agreements in which our Government has participated in negotiating, we have never ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that no one younger than 18 at the time of the crime shall be executed. I hope the Supreme Court will support that principle. If it doesn't, I hope that the legislature or the governor of Oklahoma will see the light. We are now the only Western, industrialized nation that still uses the death penalty, which embarrasses me. ROBERT A. PUTNEY   DeLand, Fla., March 29, 1988"
