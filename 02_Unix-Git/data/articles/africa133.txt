"To the Editor: Your Oct. 22 news article presents a devastating picture of the deteriorating situation in Liberia, where a civil war has resulted in an estimated 150,000 deaths since 1990. However, you fail to point out the heavy toll taken on the children of Liberia.  An estimated 6,000 children under age 15 have fought for the warring factions. Child soldiers armed with assault rifles have been killed or wounded and have witnessed atrocities. Many have taken part in the killing, maiming or rape of civilians. Many guard military checkpoints, where they have harassed, wounded or sometimes killed noncombatants. When we visited Liberia last April, some children told us they had been forcibly recruited, but most said they had joined voluntarily, seeing no other way to survive. Some have endured brutal initiation rites during which they have been forced to kill a captured opponent to demonstrate their trustworthiness. The international community must pressure Government and rebel forces to stop this destruction of children's lives. LOIS WHITMAN Director, Children's Rights Project Human Rights Watch New York, Oct. 25, 1994"
