"A group of lawyers urged today that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq be tried for war crimes before an international tribunal. ""It's astonishing that the person who should be in prison is still in power,"" said Irwin Cotler, chairman of the group, called Nuremberg 2. ""It makes a mockery of international law and the grounds under which the international community and the Security Council went to war."" Nuremberg 2, whose seven members include Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard University and George P. Fletcher of Columbia University, has drafted a model indictment it said could be used by the United Nations to bring Mr. Hussein to justice. The indictment charges him with crimes against humanity, crimes against peace and war crimes, including genocide against the Kurds. Mr. Cotler is a law professor at McGill University in Montreal and a visiting professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem."
