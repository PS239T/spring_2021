"Citing numerous instances of politically inspired torture, murder and kidnappings in Colombia, the Americas Watch Committee has called for an end to United States military aid to that country. The committee, a human rights monitoring group affiliated with the Fund for Free Expression, made the recommendation in a recent report based on the personal investigation of conditions in Colombia by Aryeh Neier, its vice chairman. According to the report, Mr. Neier visited Colombia in September and interviewed, among others, the Ministers of Justice and Defense, lawyers, judges, leaders of Indian organizations, victims of torture, members of families of kidnapping victims and officers of the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the principal human rights group in that country. In his report, Mr. Neier asserts the State Department's report on human rights for 1981 ''is either deliberately misleading or, at best, woefully inadequate.'' The State Department document, he says, conveys ''no sense of pervasive oppression,'' noting for example that ''while allegations have been made, there were no confirmed cases of disappearnces.'' A press aide to the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, Elliott Abrams, said the department ''stands by'' its report. The United States currently provides about $13 million a year in direct military aid to Colombia. The Americas Watch report, entitled ''Human Rights in the Two Colombias: Functioning Democracy, Militarized Society,'' says that President Belisario Betancur, who assumed office on Aug. 7, has not been able to gain control over the armed forces, who ''are answerable only to themselves.''"
