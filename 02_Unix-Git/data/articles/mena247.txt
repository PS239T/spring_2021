"To the Editor: ""Israel Says That a Prisoner's Tale Links Arabs in U.S. to Terrorism"" (front page, Feb. 17) reads more like Israeli propaganda than news. Ostensibly, the article is about two Palestinian-Americans held in an Israeli prison. We read an unbalanced and scurrilious account full of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim innuendoes. Rather than interviewing the American prisoners for their side, you quote Israeli sources more than 20 times. One wonders whether the article would have been written differently had the jailers not been Israeli and the prisoners not Arab-Americans. Would you have placed so little significance on the blatant denial of due process, including detention without charges, without bail, without legal counsel and without medical care? Let us measure all human rights abuses, especially against fellow citizens (even Arabs and Muslims), with one yardstick.
