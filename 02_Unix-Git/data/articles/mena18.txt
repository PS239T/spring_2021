"Senator John G. Tower expressed the need here today for more American military and economic aid for Turkey.  The Texas Republican, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, repeatedly expressed his belief in ''the good motives'' of Turkey's military rulers and in their intention to restore parlamentary democracy ''as soon as is practicable.'' The words of support came as a welcome buttress to the military leadership, which has come under attack by the Council of Europe for alleged abuses of human rights. The Council's Assembly warned last month that Turkey's membership would be reviewed in May and urged that in the meantime the Turkish Government take steps toward a return to democracy and respect for human rights. Thousand Reported Detained The Council's report expressed concern that democratic rights were not being observed in Turkey, that thousands of people were being illegally detained and that there were cases of torture and censorship of the press in various forms. ''Sometimes it takes rather dramatic action to preserve the democratic process for future generations,'' Senator Tower said at a news conference at the end of his one-day visit to Turkey. ''I have every reason to believe in the good motives of this Government. I have every reason to believe they took the measures they took reluctantly, and I look forward to the day when parliamentary democracy can be restored with more prospects for stability and success.'' The Senator dismissed a question about growing reports of the use of torture in Turkey by saying: ''There are always people in this world who can find something to point to with great alarm and criticism when there's been the kind of significant political change that there has been in this country."
