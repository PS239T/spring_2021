"A human-rights group charged yesterday that Ugandan civilians continue to be unlawfully detained and systematically tortured by troops and security forces of the Government of President Milton Obote. The report, by Amnesty International, said the findings were based on examinations given by two physicians last February to 16 Ugandans who had been imprisoned between early 1981 and late 1984 before fleeing the country. According to the doctors, 15 of the refugees showed symptoms and other medical evidence consistent with the tortures they told of having undergone. Reports of widespread killings, mass arrests, disappearances and large numbers of bodies left behind by unknown killers have come from Uganda with regularity since the fall of the regime of Idi Amin in April 1979. But the Ugandan Government has consistently denied such accounts, attributing what killings there have been to Amin loyalists, other anti-Government guerrillas and bandits. Last August, a Roman Catholic prelate from Uganda, Emmanuel Cardinal Nsubuga, asserted on a visit to Boston that the Kampala Government was holding about 80,000 people without charges in detention camps. Charges by U.S. Official And Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, told Congress at that time that more than 100,000 Ugandans might have died in Uganda, many of them last year, by starvation or direct army action. Mr. Abrams said as many as 200,000 people had been killed by the army in sweeps against guerrillas over the preceding four years. At the same time, officials voiced doubt that the Ugandan Government deliberately killed innocent civilians, indicating that they held undisciplined soldiers in the countryside responsible for robbing, raping and killing civilians suspected of having collaborated with guerrillas."
