"A United Nations human rights report on Afghanistan, made public today, cites widespread atrocities by Government and Soviet troops. ''Largely typical of the atrocities,'' the report said, are the bombing of villages, the disembowelment or kicking. The report was compiled by Felix Ermacora of Austria, a special investigator on Afghanistan for the United Nations Human Rights Commission."
