"Amnesty International, the human rights group, said yesterday that mass killings of civilians and torture of political prisoners had become widespread in Uganda in the last year and a half. The rights group said in a 28-page report that the atrocities were being committed mainly by the army and security forces on purported grounds of national security. The report, titled ''Human Rights Violations in Uganda: Extrajudicial Executions, Torture and Political Imprisonment,'' is based on testimony from former prisoners who told of whippings with barbed wire, female prisoners being raped, prisoners beaten and bayoneted to death, and of bodies being loaded on trucks that were driven to unknown destinations. Similar excesses were widely reported under the regime of Idi Amin, who was overthrown in April 1979. Milton Obote was returned to power after three interim Governments."
