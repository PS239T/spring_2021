"Amnesty International accused the Turkish authorities today of routinely torturing political detainees and said it had received reports of torture almost daily in the last two months. In a report made public today, the human rights organization said the Turkish Government has begun a public relations campaign to improve its image abroad, but has taken no effective steps to improve its ''appalling human rights record.'' Amnesty International said 250,000 political prisoners had been detained in Turkey in the 1980's and ''almost all of them were tortured.'' Thousands were imprisoned for non-violent political or religious activities; more than 60,000 were convicted after unfair trials; more than 700 death sentences were imposed, and more than 200 prisoners have died in custody, Amnesty International said. The London-based organization said it sent urgent appeals to the Turkish Government in November and December. But it said Turkey had apparently made no effort to change the ''brutal reality of torture, deaths in custody, political imprisonment and unfair trials.'' The report issued today was a special update to a regular Amnesty International report on Turkey issued in November."
