"Amnesty International today accused the Philippine Government and Government-backed forces of carrying out unlawful killings, including mutilations and a beheading, in the name of preventing an insurgency. A report issued by the international human rights organization documented scores of cases of Philippine men, women and children whose rights it said had been brutally violated. Amnesty said the killings had become the most serious human rights problem in the country since mid-1987. ''Most of the victims were targeted either for their membership of legal left-wing organizations or their suspected political beliefs,'' the report said. Amnesty said the killers ''belonged to the regular military and police forces, paramilitary civil defense forces and 'vigilante' groups acting with Government support.'' In Manila, the head of the Government's Presidential Commission on Human Rights described the report as exaggerated and one-sided. The official, Mary Concepcion Bautista, said said the military had cooperated with the Government in its push to stop abuses and had been quietly purging its ranks of violators."
