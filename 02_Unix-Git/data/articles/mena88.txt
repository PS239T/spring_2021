"Amnesty International charged yesterday that the Syrian security forces have tortured thousands of political prisoners in recent years, including large numbers of Palestinians seized from refugee districts in Syria or from Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon. The international human rights organization said that a number of political detainees are reported to have died in Syrian prisons in recent years as a result of torture, routine mistreatment or poor prison conditions. Other prisoners were said to be seriously ill and in need of medical treatment. ''It seems that the direct involvement of Syrian security forces in rights violations has the approval of the Government,'' said David Aasen, Amnesty International coordinator for European and Middle Eastern programs, ''and so we feel obliged to bring it to public attention.'' Although the total number of political prisoners in Syria is not known, Mr. Aasen estimated that ''thousands'' were being held, including more than l,000 Palestinian supporters of Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Charges of Torture In a detailed report, Amnesty International names five security agencies responsible for human rights abuses and provides much testimony to support charges of torture since 1983. The victims, it said, came from across the political spectrum. For the first time, the group reports that Syrian security forces have been detaining significant numbers of Lebanese and Palestinians in Lebanon and bringing them to Syria. The Syrian crackdown on Palestinian activists appears to have developed since June 1983, when Mr. Arafat was expelled from Damascus for accusing the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, of dividing Palestinian ranks."
