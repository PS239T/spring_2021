"What does it take to get the United States Government to express revulsion and horror? Washington has expressed only perfunctory concern about the Sudan, the vast northeast African country where a wave of political terror has claimed doctors, lawyers, journalists, poets and trade unionists. Hundreds have been detained and scores executed for the crime of dissent. With the connivance of Colonel Qaddafi of Libya, an Islamic fundamentalist regime now foments civil war and tribal massacres. These are the disastrous fruits of a military coup last June that deposed an elected civilian Government led by President Sadiq al-Mahdi. Before the coup, Khartoum boasted more than 40 newspapers and periodicals; its press was among the freest on the continent. Since then the press has been shackled, trade unions abolished and political parties stripped of their property by military rulers led by Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir. General Bashir proclaimed an Islamic republic, with results that have turned the White Nile red. In December, 600 southern Sudanese were slaughtered at el Jebelein, literally on the bank of the river. Torture, now routine, was used to extract ''confessions'' from 28 officers executed in April for allegedly plotting a coup. In a country desperately in need of doctors, dozens are in detention; one died under torture. All this has been detailed by human rights monitors, notably Africa Watch. Washington has yet to find words to condemn this lurch into darkness. It is hard to see why. General Bashir has made common cause with Libya, which he has agreed to join in a ''complete union'' in four years. With weapons furnished by Libya and Iraq, he has intensified a murderous war against the non-Islamic peoples in the south. Though once-generous U.S. aid has been shaved to the bone, there is need for more convincing evidence that Americans are watching, and care."
