"A former Argentine Navy petty officer was quoted in an interview published today as saying that he had taken part in the kidnapping of 200 political detainees and witnessed their torture in the late 1970's. Raul Vilarino told the Argentine magazine La Semana that detainees were tortured by suffocation in water and electric shocks and some were thrown alive out of aircraft into the River Plate after being drugged. Meanwhile, a military spokesman said Adm. Emilio E. Massera, former commander of the Navy, was formally?notified today that he would be court- martialed for his reputed role in ordering the kidnapping, torture and murder of thousands of people. Admiral Massera is one of nine former military leaders to be tried under orders of President Raul Alfonsin as part of his campaign to investigate the widespread abuse of human rights under military rule."
