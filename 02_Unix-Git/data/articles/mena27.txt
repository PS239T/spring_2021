"Many an authoritarian government has been accused of torturing its opponents, but few have felt a need to admit it. Last week, under strong pressure from West European countries and Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, the Government of Turkey confessed that, yes, 15 people in its custody had died of torture since the military took over 18 months ago. Minister of State Ilhan Oztrak disputed an Amnesty assertion that more than 70 prisoners had been tortured to death. In support of his claim that the Government has ''never approved of torture on persons under custody,'' he said nine security officials had been tried and convicted in three of the 15 acknowledged cases and that 12 other cases were in the courts. He did not say what punishment those convicted received. Without condoning torture by persons in his own Government, Mr.  Oztrak said that before the military takeover, terrorists killed an average of 22 persons a day. The Government rounded up more than 100,000 people in its campaign against terrorism."
