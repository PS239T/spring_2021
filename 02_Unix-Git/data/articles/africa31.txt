"An effort has been mounted in Congress and by human rights activists to assure a fair trial for Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a Citibank executive and Liberian opposition party leader who went on trial last week in Liberia on sedition charges. A Liberian who lives in the Washington area and frequently travels to his native land said he and others active in human rights had asked members of Congress to express their concerns in letters to Gen. Samuel K. Doe, the Liberian leader. The traveler said yesterday he had been told in a call from Liberia that the Doe Government was warned that American aid would be withdrawn, but a State Department spokesman was unable to confirm that. In addition, reports have reached Washington that Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf's trial has been postponed. The activity on this issue started suddenly in a city made somnolent by August doldrums. Most members of Congress and Administration leaders are out of town, but Congressional aides have been pressing Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf's case. ''We have asked for an official accounting from the Ambassador from Liberia,'' said Amelia L. Parker, executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus. ''It appears that there has been a significant escalation of human rights violations in Liberia in recent weeks.'' The Ambassador, Dr. G. Toe Washington, did not return calls to the embassy. Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf has many acquaintances in Washington because of her work as an economist for the World Bank before she joined Citicorp. The sedition charges against her are based on an anti-Government speech she made in Philadelphia before returning to Liberia."
