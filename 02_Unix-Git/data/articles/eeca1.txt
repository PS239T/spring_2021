"The United States delegation at the European Security Conference here plans to deliver a detailed criticism of the Soviet Union accusing Moscow of breaking every commitment contained in the 1975 Helsinki accords on detente, American officials said today. The comments will be made in four separate statements during this week's closed-door general debate at the 35-nation conference reviewing the status of detente and human rights. ''What we are going to say will make our opening speech seem mild,'' a United States official said, referring to a declaration last week by the co-chairman of the delegation, Griffin B. Bell. Mr.  Bell accused Moscow of ''brutal repression'' of human-rights activists and of ''casting a dark cloud over East-West relations'' by intervening militarily in Afghanistan. The officials said that the other co-chairman, Max M. Kampelman, would deal with alleged Soviet violations of the 10 principles of the Helsinki agreement. Officials said the speech tomorrow would center on Afghanistan. Texts Will Be Distributed Other high-ranking delegation members plan to make statements later in the week on each of the three parts of the 1975 agreement. These deal with security, economic cooperation and human contacts and freedoms. Western officials said that although the week of debate would not be public, texts would be distributed to assure full exposure.  Neutral nations are expected to join the West in attacking the Soviet Union and other Communist nations. Delegates from these countries said they would accuse the Communists of failing to honor pledges to allow family reunification and give free access to information. The week of general debate will be followed by three weeks of discussion in committees on implementation by the 35 signatory countries. The last week before a Christmas recess will be devoted to introducing new measures to promote detente."
