"To the Editor: As The Times reported on Oct. 7, the Soviet dissident movement has indeed been dealt a staggering blow by Gen. Semyon K. Tsvigun and his comrades at the K.G.B., but the movement survives. One of its major achievements was establishing an information network. Although most well-known dissidents are in jail, this network is still in place, operated by people both known and unknown to us. Today, for example, we receive news from the dissidents faster and in greater quantity than in 1975, when the Helsinki accords were signed. The unofficial, and essential, ''Chronicle of Current Events'' is still published; the latest issue just reached New York. Dissident sources such as Kronid Lubarsky's ''U.S.S.R. News Brief'' inform us of events not reported in U.S. newspapers - such as the fact that the unfortunate Vasily Nazarov - who made the front page of The Times when he and his mother barged into the American Embassy in Moscow with petitions - is now in Butyrskaya Prison. The Moscow Helsinki Watch Group still releases documents exposing human-rights violations; a recent statement describes harassment of ethnic Germans seeking to emigrate. According to The Times, General Tsvigun claims victory over the human-rights movement. It is less than that, and the cost to the Soviet Union is enormous: ever-increasing worldwide mistrust and ever-increasing domestic disaffection. ARYEH NEIER, CATHERINE A. FITZPATRICK, Helsinki Watch (U.S.), New York, Oct. 9, 1981"
