"Iran, apparently angry over a United Nations report criticizing its human rights record, today ordered the expulsion of all foreign Red Cross staff members. The move was announced by the Iranian press agency, which is monitored in Cyprus. It came days after Iran accused the International Committee of the Red Cross of helping the United Nations compile a report on human rights earlier this month. In the report, the United Nations Human Rights Commission cited torture of political prisoners and discrimination against religious minorities in Iran, and said the country should be kept under special scrutiny. A Red Cross spokesman in Geneva, Thomas Rudin, confirmed the expulsion order and said staff members had been given a week to leave Iran. He denied any inappropriate activities and said the group hoped to negotiate with the Iranian authorities to avoid a suspension of its work."
