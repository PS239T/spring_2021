"To the Editor: Charles Jacobs and Mohamed Athie, in ""Bought and Sold"" (Op-Ed, July 13), describe the existence of slavery in Mauritania and other areas of North Africa. I visited a Berber family in Mauritania in 1977, when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in neighboring Senegal. As we were served food by an elderly black man, my host said: ""He belongs to my father. His father belonged to my grandfather."" A number of people have flatly refused to believe this anecdote in the years since. None had spent time in Africa. I always ask. STUART F. BROWN Hollywood, July 21, 1994"
