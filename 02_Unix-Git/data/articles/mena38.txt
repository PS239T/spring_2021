"Amnesty International issued a report yesterday that said Egyptians suspected of opposing their Government faced years of imprisonment and repeated trials. The human rights organization said that since 1971, when Egypt adopted its Constitution, hundreds of people had been imprisoned in Egypt for political beliefs or activities. But it said most arrests occurred in the last two years. A spokesman in New York said it was hard to know exactly how many people had been held on political grounds because of the pattern of arrest, release and rearrest. But he said at least several hundred were being held and more than 500 faced trial, including about 300 members of an Islamic group, Al Jihad, and 200 people accused of left-wing political activity. ''We don't know whether torture has become a part of the system for dealing with political prisoners, but there has been a definite increase in the amount reported over the past year,'' he said. Amnesty International said some prisoners said they had been beaten with sticks, whips and rubber hoses. Others described burnings with cigarettes, hanging by the hands and feet, and threats of murder and sexual assault. Most were described as members of militant Islamic groups. Egyptian Discounts Report CAIRO, Wednesday, Feb. 16 (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali said today that the Amnesty International report was ''exaggerated and misleading.'' He said reports by other international human rights groups had praised Egypt for the legal and just trials of members of outlawed political organizations."
