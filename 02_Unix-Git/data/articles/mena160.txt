"To the Editor: You have heard over and again complaints from our nation's Jewish quarter about a double standard applied by the news media to the conduct of Israel in governing itself. And always the answer seems to be, ''Don't blame the messenger.'' Your Feb. 21 coverage of the State Department's annual report on human rights is a classic example. The first half of the article - the first 9 of 17 paragraphs - are devoted only to Israel's alleged misfeasance. Halfway down, you tell of far worse conditions in four other countries, offering but sparse details regarding them. Worse still is your three-column headline, ''State Dept. Says Israel Still Violates Arab Rights.'' No, it's not the messenger that we are criticizing; it's the unfairly balanced presentation that is objectionable.
