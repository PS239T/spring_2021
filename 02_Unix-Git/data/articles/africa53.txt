"South African security forces have arrested a black trade union leader, James Mndaweni, president of the Council of Unions of South Africa, according to labor monitoring groups. Mr. Mndaweni is being held on charges of attending an illegal gathering May 1, the groups said. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which is based in Brussels, said 165 trade unionists had been detained under the state of emergency decreed in South Africa, according to a Reuters report. The federation was also reported as saying that Alex Mahalaagje, president of the Transport and Allied Workers' Union, had been mistreated in prison and had asked to be transferred to a hospital. In another development, the human rights organization Amnesty International reported the detention of the principal and vice principal of a high school in the Cape Town area, as well as several students of the University of Cape Town. The students were identified as Essa Parker, Cassiem Parker, Imran Ishmail, Ghaalieb Harneker and Aadiel Moertat. Amnesty International said the group had been held incommunicado and without charges since security forces detained them June 15 during a prayer meeting organized at a mosque by a Moslem fundamentalist group."
