"To the Editor: ""Algeria's Agony"" (editorial, Sept. 3) calls on France to use its ""considerable influence"" to press Algeria to end the violent conflicts that have claimed at least 60,000 lives since 1992. However, France's long history of colonialism diminishes its position of influence. The United States could and should take the lead in insisting on an end to the butchery. While we agree with placing much of the blame on the ""terrorist movement,"" Amnesty International has documented many cases of torture and killings by the Government's security forces and the local militias as well. Algeria is a sovereign country, obliged under human rights treaties to insure that human rights are not violated.
