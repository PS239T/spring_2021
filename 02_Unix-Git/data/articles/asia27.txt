"Amnesty International last week turned its unflattering spotlight on human rights abuses in Pakistan, just as President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq was staging a show of civilian participation in his four-yearold military regime. In a 54-page report, Amnesty charged that 6,000 people had been arrested in March for political reasons and that many detainees had been systematically tortured, beaten, forced to remain awake or trussed and hung upside down for long periods. The Zia Government has not officially replied to the charges, but a spokesman said last week that the Amnesty report was highly exaggerated and contained lies. Government supporters sa id the torture charges were largely based on what th ey consider overblown testimony by exiles in London. Western diplom ats said there are currently 500 political prisoners in Pakistan , but noted that people are often picked up for a few months, then re leased. Whatever the truth of the assertions, they could hardly have come at a more embarrassing moment for General Zia. Two years after he first mentioned the idea, an appointed Consultative Assembly of 288 Pakistani notables convened last week to debate Government policy, question officials and make recommendations. Critics of the Zia regime noted that the body will have no policy-making power. It may provide a sounding board for criticism, but few Pakistanis may hear of it; General Zia last week announced that he was lifting press censorship but told reporters that they since political activity was still banned in Pakistan, they could write nothing about it."
