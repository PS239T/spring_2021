"The State Department said today that they had reliable reports that all eight members of Iran's Bahai National Spiritual Assembly had been executed in a campaign to stamp out the religion. Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman, said the executions were part of a ''despicable'' pattern of measures by the Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to suppress the Bahai religion. Mr. Romberg said the previous members of the Bahai council disappeared last year after being arrested. He said the eight current members of the council were arrested Dec. 13 and executed last Sunday. He called the action a grave violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Iran signed.  ''Given the adoption last month in the U.N. General Assembly by consensus, including Iran, of the declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, these despicable acts of the Khomeini regime are doubly deplorable,'' Mr. Romberg said. ''This is one more instance highlighting the lamentable human rights record of the regime in Iran.''"
