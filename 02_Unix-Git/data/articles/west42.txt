"The Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie will go on trial here sometime this year, probably in December, on charges of crimes against humanity, the chief prosecutor's office announced today. Mr. Barbie, the head of the Gestapo in Lyons from 1942 to 1944, has been held in jail in this southeastern French city since being extradited to France from Bolivia in 1983. There had been serious doubts about whether France would put the former Nazi on trial. The announcement said the trial would take several months and that the former Nazi would be protected by a bullet-proof glass cage."
