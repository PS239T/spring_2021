"Amnesty International today accused the Salvadoran Government of failing to take steps to end widespread killings of civilians by security forces. The human rights group said the ''blatant failure'' of the Government to investigate killings of civilians suggested that the authorities were implicated in the action. Amnesty International said independent investigation of the violence had been obstructed by the arrest, torture and murder of the doctors and lawyers who would normally undertake such a task. This made it impossible to put a definite figure on the number of killings in El Salvador in five years of political violence, Amnesty said, but it quoted unofficial estimates putting the death toll since 1979 as high as 40,000. The group also condemned murders by guerrillas."
