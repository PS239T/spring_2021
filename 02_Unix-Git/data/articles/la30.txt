"The American lawyer who heads the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has been elected to a second term despite an attack on him and the commission's work by the Chilean Government. The commission, an arm of the Organization of American States that monitors human rights abuses in Latin America, unanimously re-elected Tom J. Farer as president last week when it opened a two-week session to draft reports on human rights conditions in Bolivia, Colombia and Nicaragua. The dispute between Mr. Farer and Chile began when Pedro Daza, Chile's Ambassador to the O.A.S., denounced Mr. Farer, the first American to hold elected office in the organization, for criticizing Chile in an article he wrote for The New York Review of Books. In the article, published March 16, Mr. Farer wrote that Chile was not a democracy and that it had been guilty of human rights violations. Mr. Daza asserted in his formal protest that Mr. Farer had ''sullied the dignity of the high office that he performs'' by expressing such views in the article. He also announced that as a result of the article Chile would suspend cooperation with the human rights commission. Mr. Farer, in a written response to the criticism, said that the article had merely stated facts consistent with the commission's formal conclusions about Chile."
