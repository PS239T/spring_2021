"Amnesty International said today that more than 120 people may have been secretly executed this year in Cameroon because of suspected involvement in an attempted coup. Political prisoners, sentenced after brief military trials, were reported to have been tortured in Cameroon jails, the international human rights organization said in a statement released in London. The Cameroon Government of President Paul Biya announced six weeks after an attempted coup in April that more than 400 people had been tried in closed military tribunals and said 46 were sentenced to death. But Amnesty said it ''had received many reports of secret executions, and that well-informed sources put the total at over 120.''"
