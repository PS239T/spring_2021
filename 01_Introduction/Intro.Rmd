# About me

- Substantially, interested in historical comparative approaches to the study of race, ethnicity, and politics 
- Methodologically, interested in using natural language processing and text analysis as a way of creating new data in race scholarship
- Also, a former tech industry person married to an engineer

# Motivation 
```{r pressure}
# create an object for data science google trend results
data_science_trends <- gtrends("data science")

ggplot(data_science_trends$interest_over_time, aes(date, hits)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Global search popularity for 'data science'")

- Why should we care?
- Yes, big data is a trend. 
- But being good at computational tools and techniques has more immediate benefits. 
- It can make your life **easy** and **organized**.
    - Don't repeat yourself: AUTOMATE!
    
---

- In addition, there are new tools for 
    - Data collection (e.g., APIs, webscraping)
    - Analysis (e.g., machine learning)
    - Visualization (e.g., maps, social networks)
- In sum, you can do cool stuff.

---

- But it takes some **efforts** to take advantages of these new tools. 
    - You need to learn how to code **a little bit**. 
    - However, learning on your own is inefficient. 
    - More important, you can get **bad** habits.

* The following examples are adapted from https://style.tidyverse.org 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
fit_models.R

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("y is negative")
}

# Bad
fit models.R

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad 
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

# Objectives

- Tasting a wide range of computational tools 
- Getting programming fundamentals right
    - Concepts
    - Techniques 
- Learning by doing
    - Learning from your own MANY trials and errs 
    - Learning from others (please, do Google search before asking me) 

---

- Coding is similar to **cooking**.
    - So many different cuisines (programming languages).
    - But there are fundamentals. 
        - Ingredients (data)
        - Techniques (logic)
        - Recipes (workflow)
    
---

- Bad habits are **bad**.
    - Rule 1. Thou shall comment.
    - Rule 2. Thou shall reuse functions (no copy and paste).
    - Rule 3. Thou shall practice version control (no final_final_final.Rmd).

---

- **Learn to learn**
- Specifically, we are going to learn:
    - How to use the command line in a UNIX environment 
    - How to use Git to do version control 
    - How ch use R to clean, wrangle, analyze, and visualize data (with a focus on Wickham's tidy data principles) 
    - How to use R/Python to parse HTML, CSS, and Javascript for webscraping and (a bit of) Qualtrics (by Julia) 
    - How to use R/Python to do text analysis and machine learning (guest lectures by two Berkeley Institute for Data Science fellows)

--- 

- **Don't expect**
    - Becoming a data scientist within one semester 
    - I can answer all of your questions 
- We focus on learning **how to learn**.
    - Programming is one endless Google Search (aka "Rochelle's Law")

---


- Using Excel: 
    - 3 mins for copying, pasting, and reorganizing one article 
    - 80,000 newspaper articles 
    - Taking **4,000** hours or **166 days**

---

- Using python: 
    - A few hours for coding 
    - Less than 5 mins for creating the dataset 
    - Also, the code is reusable.

# Focus on best practice

- Good habits are **good**.
    - Commenting serves you and many other people.
    - Reusing functions provides opportunities to learn and clean up your mess.
    - Practicing version control is how we become a mature researcher and a coder.

# Class 

- Participation (25%)
    - Be nice to each other. We're all learning (especially me).
- Homework (50%)
    - Every week. 
    - Learning how to code is like learning how to drive.
- Final project (25%)
    - Feasibility is your friend. Late Feb proposal, April presentations.

# Logistics
- Learning by doing
- Pair-programming on in-class challenges
- Section is required
- Julia Christensen is a technical assistant to the course.

# Special thanks 
- Laura Stoker (UC Berkeley) for supporting this course at its initial developmental stage
- Rochelle Terman (Chicago) for creating this course
- Rachel Bernhard (Oxford, UC Davis) for continuing this course
