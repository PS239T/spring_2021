- Why should we care?
- Yes, big data is a trend. 
- But being good at computational tools and techniques has more immediate benefits. 
- It can make your life **easy** and **organized**.
    - Don't repeat yourself: AUTOMATE!
    
---

- In addiiton, there are new tools for 
    - Data collection (e.g., APIs, webscraping)
    - Analysis (e.g., machine learning)
    - Visualization (e.g., maps, social networks)
- In sum, you can do cool stuff.

---

- But it takes some **efforts** to take advantages of these new tools. 
    - You need to learn how to code **a little bit**. 
    - However, leanring on your own is inefficient. 
    - More important, you can get **bad** habits.

* The following examples are adapted from https://style.tidyverse.org 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
fit_models.R

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("y is negative")
}

# Bad
fit models.R

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

```

--- 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad 
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

# Objectives

- Tasting a wide range of computational tools 
- Getting programming fundamentals right
    - Concepts
    - Techniques 
- Learning by doing
    - Learning from your own trials and erros 
    - Learning from others

- Coding is similar to **cooking**.
    - So many different cuisines (programming languages).
    - But there are fudamentals. 
        - Ingredients (data)
        - Techniques (logic)
        - Recipes (workflow)
    
---

- Bad habits are **bad**.
    - Rule 1. Thou shall comment.
    - Rule 2. Thou shall reuse functions (no copy and paste).
    - Rule 3. Thou shall practice version control (no final_final_final.Rmd)

---

- **Learn to learn**
- Specifically, we are going to learn:
    - Navigate and operate effectively in a UNIX environment 
    - Master basic Git and Github workflows 
    - Write, execute, and debug R code for data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization and machine learning 
    - Parse HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the purposes of using tools like APIs, webscraping, and Qualtrics 
    - Write, execute, and debug R/Python code for text analysis, as well as other computing tasks 

--- 

- **Don't expect** you become:
    - A software programmer (we covere only a tip of the iceberg)
    - Get all the answers you need
- We focus on learning **how to learn**.

# Practical examples 

![Turning html documents into a dataset](/home/jae/Pictures/Screenshot from 2018-10-27 22-47-43.png){width=400px}

---

- Using Excel: 
    - 3 mins for copying, pasting, and reorganizing one article 
    - 80,000 newspaper articles 
    - Taking **4,000** hours or **166 days**

---

- Using python: 
    - A few hours for coding 
    - Less than 5 mins for creating the dataset 
    - Also, the code is reusable.

# Focus on best practice

- Good habits are **good**.
    - Commenting serves you and many other people.
    - Reusing functions provides opportunities to learn and clean up your mess.
    - Practicing version control is how we become a mature researcher and a coder.

# Class 

- Participation (25%)
    - Be kind and nice to each other. We're all leanring (especially me).
- Homework (50%)
    - Every week. 
    - Learning how to code is like learning how to drive.
- Final project (25%)
    - Feasibility is your friend. Late Feb proposal, April presentations.

# Logistics
- Learning by doing 
- Pair-programming on in-class challenges 
- Section is required. 
- Julia Christensen is a technical assistant to the course.

# Special thanks 
- Rochelle Terman (University of Chicago)
- Rachel Bernhard (University of Oxford, UC Davis)
