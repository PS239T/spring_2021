- Why should we care?
- Yes, big data (or machine learning) is a trend. 
- But computational tools and techniques are much broader and fundamental to how we research:
    - Data collection (e.g., APIs, webscraping)
    - Analysis (e.g., text analysis, machine learning)
    - Visualization (e.g., maps, social networks)

--- 

- Using Excel: 
    - 3 mins for copying, pasting, and reorganizing one article 
    - 80,000 newspaper articles 
    - Taking **4,000** hours or **166 days**

---

- Using python: 
    - A few hours for coding 
    - Less than 5 mins for creating the dataset 
    - Also, the code is reusable.

- Yet it takes some **efforts** to take advantages of these new tools. 
    - You need to learn how to code **a little bit**. 
    - However, learning on your own is inefficient. 
    - More important, you can get **bad** habits.

* The following examples are adapted from https://style.tidyverse.org 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
fit_models.R

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("y is negative")
}

# Bad
fit models.R

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Good 
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad 
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

- Three commandments
    - Thou shall comment.
    - Thou shall reuse functions (no copy and paste).
    - Thou shall practice version control (no final_final_final.Rmd).

- Coding is similar to **cooking**.
    - So many different cuisines (programming languages).
    - But there are fundamentals. 
        - Ingredients (data)
        - Techniques (logic)
        - Recipes (workflow)

# Objectives

- Tasting a wide range of computational tools 
- Getting programming fundamentals right
    - Concepts
    - Techniques 
- Learning by doing
    - Learning from your own MANY trials and errors 
    - Learning from others (please, do Google search before asking me) 

---

- **Don't expect**
    - Becoming a data scientist within one semester 
    - I can answer all of your questions. 
- We focus on learning **how to learn**.
    - Programming is one endless Google Search (aka "Rochelle's Law")
