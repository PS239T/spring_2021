\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

This course will help social science graduate students to think
computationally and develop proficiency with computational tools and
techniques, necessary to conduct research in computational social
science. Mastering these tools and techniques not only enables students
to collect, wrangle, analyze, and interpret data with less pain and more
fun, but it also let students to work on research projects that would
previously seem impossible.

\hypertarget{textbook}{%
\subsection{Textbook}\label{textbook}}

\href{https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/}{The online book version} of the
course materials by Jae Yeon Kim is currently work in progress.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The goal of this course is to help students become a more efficient
  and innovative researcher by leveraging the power of automation.
\item
  The course is currently divided into two main subjects (fundamentals
  and applications) and six main sessions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{part-i-fundamentals}{%
\subsubsection{Part I Fundamentals}\label{part-i-fundamentals}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the first section, students learn best practices in data and code
  management using Git and Bash.
\item
  In the second, students learn how to wrangle, model, and visualize
  data easier and faster.
\item
  In the third, students learn how to use functions to automate repeated
  things and develop their own data tools (e.g., R packages, Shiny
  apps).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{part-ii-applications}{%
\subsubsection{Part II Applications}\label{part-ii-applications}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the fourth, students learn how to collect and parse semi-structured
  data at scale (e.g., scraping websites, PDF files, and social media
  posts).
\item
  In the fifth, students learn how to analyze high-dimensional data
  (e.g., text) using machine learning.
\item
  In the final, students learn how to access, query, and manage big data
  using SQL.
\end{itemize}

We will learn how to do all of the above mostly in
\href{https://www.r-project.org/about.html}{\textbf{R}}, and sometimes
in \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}{\textbf{bash}} and
\href{https://www.python.org/about/}{\textbf{Python}}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Why R? R is free, easy to learn (thanks to
  \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{tidyverse}} and
  \href{https://rstudio.com/}{RStudio}), fast (thanks to
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html}{\texttt{rcpp}}),
  runs everywhere, \textbf{open} (16,000+ packages; counting only ones
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/}{available at CRAN}),
  and has a growing massive and inclusive community
  (\href{https://twitter.com/search?q=\%23rstats\&src=typed_query}{\texttt{\#rstats}}).
\item
  Why R + Python + bash?

  \begin{quote}
  \begin{quote}
  ``For R and Python, Python is first and foremost a programming
  language. And that has a lot of good features, but it tends to mean,
  that if you are going to do data science in Python, you have to first
  learn how to program in Python. Whereas I think you are going to get
  up and running faster with R, than with Python because there's just a
  bunch more stuff built in and you don't have to learn as many
  programming concepts. You can focus on being a great political
  scientist or whatever you do and learning enough R that you don't have
  to become an expert programmer as well to get stuff done.'' - Hadley
  Wickham
  \end{quote}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    However, this feature of the R community also raises a challenge.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{quote}
  \begin{quote}
  Compared to other programming languages, the R community tends to be
  more focused on results instead of processes. Knowledge of software
  engineering best practices is patchy: for instance, not enough R
  programmers use source code control or automated testing.
  Inconsistency is rife across contributed packages, even within base R.
  You are confronted with over 20 years of evolution every time you use
  R. R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly
  written R code can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of
  memory. - Hadley Wickham
  \end{quote}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    RStudio, especially the tidyverse team, has made heroic efforts to
    amend the problems listed above. In this course, you will learn
    these recent advances in the R ecosystem and how to complement R
    with Python and Bash.
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{office-hours}{%
\subsubsection{Office hours}\label{office-hours}}

By appointment.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Jae Yeon Kim: I will post a link to schedule a meeting soon. (TBD)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{slack-github}{%
\subsubsection{Slack \& GitHub}\label{slack-github}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://slack.com/}{Slack} for communication (announcements and
  questions). You should ask questions about class material and
  assignments through the Slack channels so that everyone can benefit
  from the discussion. We encourage you to respond to each other's
  questions as well.\\
\item
  \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub} for everything else, including
  turning in assignments (except final project proposals, which will be
  submitted to Slack). Students are required to use GitHub for their
  final projects, which will be publicly available, unless they have
  special considerations (e.g.~proprietary data). All course materials
  will be posted on GitHub at
  \url{https://github.com/PS239T/spring_2021}, including class notes,
  code demonstrations, sample data, and assignments.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsubsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

This class is committed to creating an environment in which everyone can
participate, regardless of background, discipline, or disability. If you
have a particular concern, please come to me as soon as possible so that
we can make special arrangements.

\hypertarget{course-requirements-and-grades}{%
\subsubsection{Course requirements and
grades}\label{course-requirements-and-grades}}

This is a graded class based on the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Completion of assigned homework (50\%)
\item
  Participation (25\%)
\item
  Final project (25\%)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\paragraph{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

Assignments will be assigned at the end of every session using
\href{https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/72813915-ps239t-spring-2021}{GitHub
Classroom}. They will be due at the start of the following class unless
otherwise noted. The assignments will be frequent but each of them
should be fairly short.

You are encouraged to work in groups, but the work you turn in must be
your own. Group submission of homework, or turning in copies of the same
code or output, is not acceptable. Remember, the only way you actually
learn how to write code is to write code.

Unless otherwise specified, assignments should be submitted to the
GitHub Classroom site. This setup is important for the instructors to
\textbf{review and provide comments on the students' code.} Also, it
helps students to learn how to version control using Bash, Git, and
GitHub.

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\paragraph{Class participation}\label{class-participation}}

The class participation portion of the grade can be satisfied in one or
more of the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  attending the lecture and section (note that section is non-optional)
\item
  asking and answering questions in class
\item
  contributing to class discussion through the bCourse site, and/or
\item
  collaborating with the campus computing community, either by attending
  a D-Lab or BIDS workshop, submitting a pull request to a campus github
  repository (including the class repository), answering a question on
  StackExchange, or other involvement in the social computing / digital
  humanities community.
\end{itemize}

Because we will be using laptops every class, the temptation to attend
to other things during slow moments will be high. While you may choose
to do so, I do request that you think of your laptop screen as in the
public domain for the duration of classtime. \textbf{Please do not load
anything that will distract your classmates or is otherwise
inappropriate to a classroom setting.}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\paragraph{Final project}\label{final-project}}

The final project consists of using the tools we learned in class on
your own data of interest. First- and second-year students in the
political science department are encouraged to use this as an
opportunity to gather data to be used for other courses or the
second-year thesis. Students are required to write a short proposal by
March (no more than 2 paragraphs) in order to get approval and feedback
from the instructor.

During sections in April we will have \textbf{lightning talk sessions}
where students present their projects in a maximum 5 minute talk, with 5
minutes for class Q\&A. Since there is no expectation of a formal paper,
you should select a project that is completable by the end of the term.
In other words, submitting a research design for your future
dissertation that will use skills from the class but collects no data is
not acceptable, but completing a viably small portion of a study or
thesis is.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{class-activities-and-materials}{%
\subsubsection{Class activities and
materials}\label{class-activities-and-materials}}

\hypertarget{lecture}{%
\paragraph{Lecture}\label{lecture}}

Classes will follow a ``workshop'' style, combining lecture and lab
formats. The class is interactive, with students programming every
session. During the ``skills'' parts of the class, we will be learning
how to program in R, UNIX (bash), and Python by following course notes
and tutorials. During the ``applications'' sections, we will follow a
similar structure, with occasional guest speakers.

\hypertarget{section}{%
\paragraph{Section}\label{section}}

The ``lab'' section will generally be a less formal session dedicated to
helping students with materials from lecture and homework. It will be
mostly student led, so come with questions. If there are no questions,
the lab turns into a ``hackathon'' where groups can work on the
assignments together. Section is required unless prior permission to
miss it is obtained from both the instructor and one's groupmates.
Attending office hours is not a substitute for attending section.

\hypertarget{computer-requirements}{%
\paragraph{Computer requirements}\label{computer-requirements}}

The software needed for the course is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Access to the UNIX command line (e.g., a Mac laptop, a Bash wrapper on
  Windows)
\item
  Git
\item
  R and RStudio (latest versions)
\item
  Anaconda and Python 3 (latest versions)
\item
  Pandoc and LaTeX
\end{itemize}

This requires a computer that can handle all this software. Almost any
Mac will do the job. Most Windows machines are fine too if they have
enough space and memory.

You must have all the software downloaded and installed PRIOR to the
first day of class. If there are issues with installation on your
machine, please
\href{https://github.com/PS239T/spring_2021/issues}{create issues} on
the course GitHub repository.
