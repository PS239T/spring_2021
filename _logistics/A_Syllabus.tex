\hypertarget{overview}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

This course will help social science graduate students to think
computationally and develop proficiency with computational tools and
techniques, necessary to conduct research in computational social
science. Mastering these tools and techniques not only enables students
to collect, wrangle, analyze, and interpret data with less pain and more
fun, but it also let students to work on research projects that would
previously seem impossible.

\hypertarget{textbook}{%
\subsection{Textbook}\label{textbook}}

\href{https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/}{The online book version} of the
course materials is currently work in progress. Jae is loosely aiming
the completion of this book in Spring 2021.

\hypertarget{objectives}{%
\subsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The goal of this course is to help students become a more efficient
  and innovative researcher by leveraging the power of automation.
\item
  The course is currently divided into two main subjects (fundamentals
  and applications) and six main sessions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{part-i-fundamentals}{%
\subsubsection{Part I Fundamentals}\label{part-i-fundamentals}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the first section, students learn best practices in data and code
  management using Git and Bash.
\item
  In the second, students learn how to wrangle, model, and visualize
  data easier and faster.
\item
  In the third, students learn how to use functions to automate repeated
  things and develop their own data tools (e.g., packages).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{part-ii-applications}{%
\subsubsection{Part II Applications}\label{part-ii-applications}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the fourth, students learn how to collect and parse semi-structured
  data at scale (e.g., using APIs and webscraping).
\item
  In the fifth, students learn how to analyze high-dimensional data
  (e.g., text) using machine learning.
\item
  In the final, students learn how to access, query, and manage big data
  using SQL. We will learn how to do all of the above mostly in
  \href{https://www.r-project.org/about.html}{\textbf{R}}, and sometimes
  in \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}{\textbf{bash}} and
  \href{https://www.python.org/about/}{\textbf{Python}}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Why R? R is free, easy to learn (thanks to
    \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{tidyverse}} and
    \href{https://rstudio.com/}{RStudio}), fast (thanks to
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html}{\texttt{rcpp}}),
    runs everywhere, \textbf{open} (16,000+ packages; counting only ones
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/}{available at CRAN}),
    and has a growing massive and inclusive community
    (\href{https://twitter.com/search?q=\%23rstats\&src=typed_query}{\texttt{\#rstats}}).
  \item
    Why R + Python + bash?

    \begin{quote}
    \begin{quote}
    ``For R and Python, Python is first and foremost a programming
    language. And that has a lot of good features, but it tends to mean,
    that if you are going to do data science in Python, you have to
    first learn how to program in Python. Whereas I think you are going
    to get up and running faster with R, than with Python because
    there's just a bunch more stuff built in and you don't have to learn
    as many programming concepts. You can focus on being a great
    political scientist or whatever you do and learning enough R that
    you don't have to become an expert programmer as well to get stuff
    done.'' - Hadley Wickham
    \end{quote}
    \end{quote}
  \item
    However, this feature of the R community also raises a challenge.

    \begin{quote}
    \begin{quote}
    Compared to other programming languages, the R community tends to be
    more focused on results instead of processes. Knowledge of software
    engineering best practices is patchy: for instance, not enough R
    programmers use source code control or automated testing.
    Inconsistency is rife across contributed packages, even within base
    R. You are confronted with over 20 years of evolution every time you
    use R. R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly
    written R code can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of
    memory. - Hadley Wickham
    \end{quote}
    \end{quote}
  \item
    RStudio, especially the tidyverse team, has made heroic efforts to
    amend the problems listed above. In this course, you will learn
    these recent advances in the R ecosystem and how to complement R
    with Python and Bash.
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{time-and-location}{%
\subsubsection{Time and location}\label{time-and-location}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lecture: Mondays 9-11am (Zoom)
\item
  Section: Fridays 8-10am (Zoom)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{office-hours}{%
\subsubsection{Office hours}\label{office-hours}}

Office hours will be held by both instructors on Zoom at pre-specified
times. Nick's office hours will be from 11am-12pm on Mondays (Zoom).
Jae's office hours will be from 11am-12pm on Fridays (Zoom). Both
instructors will be available for appointments at any time.

\hypertarget{slack-github}{%
\subsubsection{Slack \& GitHub}\label{slack-github}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://slack.com/}{Slack} for communication (announcements and
  questions). You should ask questions about class material and
  assignments through the Slack channels so that everyone can benefit
  from the discussion. We encourage you to respond to each other's
  questions as well.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub} for everything else, including
  turning in assignments (except final project proposals, which will be
  submitted to Slack). Students are required to use GitHub for their
  final projects, which will be publicly available, unless they have
  special considerations (e.g.~proprietary data). All course materials
  will be posted on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/jaeyk/PS239T},
  including class notes, code demonstrations, sample data, and
  assignments.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsubsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

This class is committed to creating an environment in which everyone can
participate, regardless of background, discipline, or disability. If you
have a particular concern, please come to me as soon as possible so that
we can make special arrangements.

\hypertarget{course-requirements-and-grades}{%
\subsubsection{Course requirements and
grades}\label{course-requirements-and-grades}}

This is a graded class based on the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Completion of assigned homework (50\%)
\item
  Participation (25\%)
\item
  Final project (25\%)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\paragraph{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

Assignments will be assigned at the end lectures. They will be due at
the start of the following class unless otherwise noted. The assignments
will be frequent but each of them should be fairly short. For the
fundamentals section, there will be a problem set assigned at the end of
every lecture. For the applications section, you will have the option to
select the two problem sets you wish to complete. Note that during this
time, you should be working on your final project, as well.

You are encouraged to work in groups, but the work you turn in must be
your own. Group submission of homework, or turning in copies of the same
code or output, is not acceptable. Remember, the only way you actually
learn how to write code is to write code. Unless otherwise specified,
assignments should be turned in as \textbf{both} (1) an .Rmd file and
(2) the resulting pdf documents via the bCourses site. \textbf{All .Rmd
files should be reproducible on our end, in the event that we want to
see what you have done to produce your analyses.}

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\paragraph{Class participation}\label{class-participation}}

The class participation portion of the grade can be satisfied in one or
more of the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  attending the lecture and section (note that section is non-optional)
\item
  asking and answering questions in class
\item
  contributing to class discussion through the bCourse site, and/or
\item
  collaborating with the campus computing community, either by attending
  a D-Lab or BIDS workshop, submitting a pull request to a campus github
  repository (including the class repository), answering a question on
  StackExchange, or other involvement in the social computing / digital
  humanities community.
\end{itemize}

Because we will be using laptops every class, the temptation to attend
to other things during slow moments will be high. While you may choose
to do so, I do request that you think of your laptop screen as in the
public domain for the duration of classtime. Please do not load anything
that will distract your classmates or is otherwise inappropriate to a
classroom setting.

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\paragraph{Final project}\label{final-project}}

The final project consists of using the tools we learned in class on
your own data of interest. First- and second-year students in the
political science department are encouraged to use this as an
opportunity to gather data to be used for other courses or the
second-year thesis. Students are required to write a short proposal by
\textbf{March} (no more than 2 paragraphs) in order to get approval and
feedback from the instructor.

During sections in April we will have \textbf{lightning talk sessions}
where students present their projects in a maximum 5 minute talk, with 5
minutes for class Q\&A. Since there is no expectation of a formal paper,
you should select a project that is completable by the end of the term.
In other words, submitting a research design for your future
dissertation that will use skills from the class but collects no data is
not acceptable, but completing a viably small portion of a study or
thesis is.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{class-activities-and-materials}{%
\subsubsection{Class activities and
materials}\label{class-activities-and-materials}}

\hypertarget{lecture}{%
\paragraph{Lecture}\label{lecture}}

Classes will follow a ``workshop'' style, combining lecture and lab
formats. The class is interactive, with students programming every
session. During the ``skills'' parts of the class, we will be learning
how to program in R, UNIX (bash), and Python by following course notes
and tutorials. During the ``applications'' sections, we will follow a
similar structure, with occasional guest speakers.

\hypertarget{section}{%
\paragraph{Section}\label{section}}

The ``lab'' section will generally be a less formal session dedicated to
helping students with materials from lecture and homework. It will be
mostly student led, so come with questions. If there are no questions,
the lab turns into a ``hackathon'' where groups can work on the
assignments together. Section is required unless prior permission to
miss it is obtained from both the instructor and one's groupmates.
Attending office hours is not a substitute for attending section.

\hypertarget{computer-requirements}{%
\paragraph{Computer requirements}\label{computer-requirements}}

The software needed for the course is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Access to the UNIX command line (e.g., a Mac laptop, a Bash wrapper on
  Windows)
\item
  Git
\item
  R and RStudio (latest versions)
\item
  Anaconda and Python 3 (latest versions)
\item
  Pandoc and LaTeX
\end{itemize}

This requires a computer that can handle all this software. Almost any
Mac will do the job. Most Windows machines are fine too if they have
enough space and memory. You must have all the software downloaded and
installed PRIOR to the first day of class. If there are issues with
installation on your machine, please contact either Nick or Jae for
further help.
