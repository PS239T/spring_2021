# Online Field Experiments 

* "Onilne" survey and lab experiments: web technology is used for recruitment and sampling and that's it.

* Online field experiments: "experiments that leverage platforms or systems that already exist on the Internet to study motivations and behaviors of individuals, organizations, and even governments".

* "The treatments and outcome of online field experiments are often native to the online setting." (Muise and Pan 2018, 2-5)
