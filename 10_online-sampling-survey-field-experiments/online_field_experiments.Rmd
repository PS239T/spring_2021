# Going beyond data mining 

[Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining): the process of divovering patterns in large data sets 

But, mostly for associations. Big data could be a boon for p-hacking. (Remember, the statistical power is a function of the size of the data set.). Don't be fooled by statistical **significance**.

[Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law): "When a measure [p-value] becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" (rephrased by Marilyn Strathern). FYI, what the heck is p-value? 

For a credible research, we need to think more than associations. (e.g., Threats to internal and external validity by Campbell and Stanley)

For causal arguments, you need to think about interventions and counterfactuals.

# Research Design and Computational Methods 

- Research design: questions -> answers 

- Research design is critical to identify causality in your project 

- Computational methods: 
    - Along with qualitative, and quantitative methods, one of many tools that will help your journey. 
    - Research design is a compatative edge for social scientists (vis-Ã -vis data scientists) in doing computational social science.

## Lesson objectives 

1. How can computational methods lead to a new discovery?
2. How can leverage the strength of the data collected by computational methods?
3. How can we mix (including computational) methods?

## Big descriptive inference

Yes, I know social media is a narrow sample. But what if my social media data covers 3 million posts...

### Research design

- Question: How Does Online Censorship in China Work?

- Platform: 1,400 Chinese social media services
- Unit of analysis: Online posts
- Data collection: 
    - web crawling locating, accessing, and downloading posts from these from many Web sites before ISP or the government censored them.
    - N: 3,674,698 
- Data analysis:
    - Stratied random sampling on hypothesized political sensitivity (created by reviewing prior literature, consulting with China specialists, and studying current events)
    - N: 127,283

## Online Data Are Good and Bad at the Same Time

How to build a panel data using Web data

### Research design

- Question: Do social movements actively shape the opinions and attitudes of participants by bringing together diverse groups that subsequently influence one another? -> How can we tease "influence" from "selection" mechanism?

- Platform: Twitter
- Unit of analysis: individual users 
- N: 30,000
- Ex-post panel construction:
    - Following both participants (also there's a subcategory divided by verified physical variable) of the movement (Occupy Gezi movement) and non-participants
    - Based on their retweet behavior in the 17 months leading up to the Gezi movement (before), during the movement (during), and the five months after the movement (after)
    - Trade-off between external and internal validity

## Going into the causal direction

* "Onilne" survey and lab experiments: web technology is used for recruitment and sampling and that's it.

* Online field experiments: "experiments that leverage platforms or systems that already exist on the Internet to study motivations and behaviors of individuals, organizations, and even governments".

* "The treatments and outcome of online field experiments are often native to the online setting." (Muise and Pan 2018, 2-5)

### Research design

- Question: measuring the authoritarian government responsiveness
- Platform: county-level government websites (identified by the web-crawling scripts)
- Unit of analysis: county
- N: 2,103
- Randomization and treatment: the authors randomly assigned message types to county websites.
    - Treatment: 1) proxying collective action potential and 2) the threat of tattling to higher-level authorities , and party loyalty
    - Control
- Outcomes: 1) whether the message received a response, 2) how many days took to get it, 3) content of the response
