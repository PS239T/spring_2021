Mastering these tools and techniques not only enables students to collect, wrangle, analyze, and interpret data with less pain and more fun, but it also let students to work on research projects that would previously seem impossible. The course is currently divided into two main subjects (fundamentals and applications) and six main sessions. Part I Fundamentals In the first section, students learn best practices in data and code management using Git and Bash. In the second, students learn how to wrangle, model, and visualize data easier and faster. In the third, students learn how to use functions to automate repeated things and develop their own data tools (e.g., packages). Part II Applications In the fourth, students learn how to collect and parse semi-structured data at scale (e.g., using APIs and webscraping). In the fifth, students learn how to analyze high-dimensional data (e.g., text) using machine learning. In the final, students learn how to access, query, and manage big data using SQL.

["Intro.html", "Chapter 3 Managing data and code 3.1 Project-oriented research 3.2 Writing code: How to code like a professional 3.3 Asking questions: Minimal reproducible example", " Chapter 3 Managing data and code 3.1 Project-oriented research 3.1.1 Computational reproducibility 3.1.1.1 Setup pacman::p_load( tidyverse, # tidyverse here # computational reproducibility ) 3.1.1.2 Motivation Why do you need to make your research project computationally reproducible? For your self-interest and public benefits. 3.1.1.3 How to organize files in a project You won’t be able to reproduce your project unless it is efficiently organized. Step 1. Environment is part of your project. If someone can’t reproduce your environment, they won’t be able to run your code. Launch R Studio. Choose Tools &gt; Global Options. You should not check Restor .RData into workspace at startup and set saving workspace option to NEVER. Step 2. For each project, create a project directory named after the project. # Don&#39;t name it a project. Use a name that&#39;s more informative. For instance, us_election not my_project. dir.create(&quot;../us_election&quot;) Step 3. Launch R Studio. Choose File &gt; New project &gt; Browse existing directories &gt; Create project This allows each project has its own workspace. Step 4. Organize files by putting them in separate subdirectories and naming them in a sensible way. Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!) and put in the data directory. dir.create(here::here(&quot;us_election&quot;, &quot;data&quot;)) Separate read-only data from processed data and put in the processed_data subdirectory. dir.create(here::here(&quot;us_election&quot;, &quot;processed_data&quot;)) Put your code in the src directory. dir.create(here::here(&quot;us_election&quot;, &quot;src&quot;)) Put generated outputs (e.g., tables, figures) in the outputs subdirectory and treat them as disposable. dir.create(here::here(&quot;us_election&quot;, &quot;outputs&quot;)) Put your custom functions in the functions subdirectory. You can put some of them together later as a package. dir.create(here::here(&quot;us_election&quot;, &quot;functions&quot;)) Challenge 2 Set a project structure for a project named “starwars”. 3.1.1.4 How to organize code in a R markdown file In addition to environment, workflow is an important component of project efficiency and reproducibility. R Markdown basic syntax # Header 1 ## Header 2 ### Header 3 Use these section headings to indicate workflow. # Import packages and data # Tidy data # Wrangle data # Model data # Visualize data Press ctrl + shift + o. You can see a document outline based on these headings. This is a nice feature for finding code you need to focus. If your project’s scale is large, then divide these sections into files, number, and save them in code subdirectory. 01_wrangling.Rmd 02_modeling.Rmd … 3.1.1.5 Making a project computationally reproducible setwd(): set a working directory. Note that using setwd() is not a reproducible way to set up your project. For instance, none will be able to run the following code except me. # Set a working directory setwd(&quot;/home/jae/starwars&quot;) # Do something ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point() # Export the object. # dot means the working directory set by setwd() ggsave(&quot;./outputs/example.png&quot;) # This is called relative path Instead, learn how to use here()’. Key idea: separate workflow (e.g., workspace information) from products (code and data). For more information, read Jenny Bryan’s wonderful piece on project-oriented workflow. Example # New: Reproducible ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point() ggsave(here(&quot;project&quot;, &quot;outputs&quot;, &quot;example.png&quot;)) How here works here() function shows what’s the top-level project directory. here::here() Build a path including subdirectories here::here(&quot;project&quot;, &quot;outputs&quot;) #depth 1 #depth 2 How here defines the top-level project directory. The following list came from the here package vignette). Is a file named .here present? Is this an RStudio Project? (Note that we already set up an RStudio Project! So, if you use RStudio’s project feature, then you are ready to use here.) Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file? Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named remake.yml? Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named .projectile? Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named .git or .svn? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported. If there’s no match then use set_here() to create an empty .here file. Challenge 1 Can you define computational reproducibility? Can you explain why sharing code and data is not enough for computational reproducibility? 3.1.2 Version control (Git and Bash) 3.1.2.1 What Is Bash? 3.1.2.1.1 Writing your first shell script Write a shell script that creates a directory called /pdfs under /Download directory, then find PDF files in /Download and copy those files to pdfs. This shell script creates a backup. #!/bin/sh mkdir /home/jae/Downloads/pdfs cd Download cp *.pdf pdfs/ echo &quot;Copied pdfs&quot; 3.1.2.2 What Are Git and GitHub? Figure 2.1. A schematic git workflow from Healy’s “The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science” 3.1.2.2.1 Basics: git push and git pull 3.1.2.2.2 Time machine: git revert 3.1.2.2.3 Parallel universe: git branch 3.1.2.2.4 User-manual: readme README.md In this simple markdown file, note some basic information about the project including the project structure. This is how I used the README.md file for this course. Check out my GitHub account to see how I manage my projects. 3.1.2.3 Deployment: GitHub Pages 3.1.2.4 Tracking progress: GitHub Issues 3.1.2.5 Project management: GitHub Dashboards 3.2 Writing code: How to code like a professional 3.2.1 Write readable code What is code style? Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style. - Google Style Guides Files When naming files: Don’t use special characters. (Spaces make filenames awkward in the console/command-line.) Don’t capitalize. (UNIX is case sensitive.) Numbering them if files should be run in an order. # Good fit_models.R # Bad fit models.R Objects When naming objects: Don’t use special characters. Don’t capitalize. # Good day_one # Bad DayOne Functions When naming functions: Don’t use special characters. Don’t capitalize. Use verbs instead of nouns. (Functions do something!) # Good run_rdd # Bad rdd Spacing # Good x[, 1] mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) # Bad x[,1] mean (x, na.rm = TRUE) Indenting # Good if (y &lt; 0) { message(&quot;y is negative&quot;) } # Bad if (y &lt; 0) { message(&quot;Y is negative&quot;)} Long lines # Good do_something_very_complicated( something = &quot;that&quot;, requires = many, arguments = &quot;some of which may be long&quot; ) # Bad do_something_very_complicated(&quot;that&quot;, requires = many, arguments = &quot;some of which may be long&quot; ) Comments Use comments to explain your decisions. But, show your code; Do not try to explain your code by comments. Also, try to comment out rather than delete the code that you experiment with. # Average sleep hours of Jae jae %&gt;% # By week group_by(week) %&gt;% # Mean sleep hours summarise(week_sleep = mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE)) Pipes (chaining commands) # Good iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% gather(measure, value, -Species) %&gt;% arrange(value) # Bad iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarize_all(mean) %&gt;% ungroup %&gt;% gather(measure, value, -Species) %&gt;% arrange(value) Additional tips Use lintr to check whether your code complies with a recommended style guideline (e.g., tidyverse) and styler package to format your code according to the style guideline. how lintr works 3.2.2 Write reusable code Pasting Copy-and-paste programming, sometimes referred to as just pasting, is the production of highly repetitive computer programming code, as produced by copy and paste operations. It is primarily a pejorative term; those who use the term are often implying a lack of programming competence. It may also be the result of technology limitations (e.g., an insufficiently expressive development environment) as subroutines or libraries would normally be used instead. However, there are occasions when copy-and-paste programming is considered acceptable or necessary, such as for boilerplate, loop unrolling (when not supported automatically by the compiler), or certain programming idioms, and it is supported by some source code editors in the form of snippets. - Wikipedia It’s okay for pasting for the first attempt to solve a problem. But if you copy and paste three times (a.k.a. Rule of Three in programming), something’s wrong. You’re working too hard. You need to be lazy. What do I mean and how can you do that? Example Let’s imagine df is a survey dataset. a, b, c, d = Survey questions -99: non-responses Your goal: replace -99 with NA # Data set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility df &lt;- tibble(&quot;a&quot; = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE), &quot;b&quot; = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE), &quot;c&quot; = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE), &quot;d&quot; = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE)) # Copy and paste df$a[df$a == -99] &lt;- NA df$b[df$b == -99] &lt;- NA df$c[df$c == -99] &lt;- NA df$d[df$d == -99] &lt;- NA df ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## a b c d ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 3 3 1 ## 2 3 2 3 1 ## 3 1 NA 1 2 ## 4 1 NA 2 1 ## 5 NA 1 1 3 Using a function function: input + computation + output If you write a function, you gain efficiency because you don’t need to copy and paste the computation part. # Create a custom function fix_missing &lt;- function(x) { # INPUT x[x == -99] &lt;- NA # COMPUTATION x # OUTPUT } # Apply the function to each column (vector) # This iterated part can and should be automated. df$a &lt;- fix_missing(df$a) df$b &lt;- fix_missing(df$b) df$c &lt;- fix_missing(df$c) df$d &lt;- fix_missing(df$d) df Automation Many options for automation in R: for loop, apply family, etc. Here’s a tidy solution comes from purrr package. The power and joy of one-liner. df &lt;- purrr::map_df(df, fix_missing) # What is this magic? We will unpack the blackbox (`map_df()`) later. df Takeaways Your code becomes more reusable, when it’s easier to change, debug, and scale up. Don’t repeat yourself and embrace the power of lazy programming. Lazy, because only lazy programmers will want to write the kind of tools that might replace them in the end. Lazy, because only a lazy programmer will avoid writing monotonous, repetitive code—thus avoiding redundancy, the enemy of software maintenance and flexible refactoring. Mostly, the tools and processes that come out of this endeavor fired by laziness will speed up the production. - Philipp Lenssen Only when your code becomes reusable, you would become efficient in your data work. Otherwise, you need to start from scratch or copy and paste, when you work on a new project. Code reuse aims to save time and resources and reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form within the software product development process.[2] The key idea in reuse is that parts of a computer program written at one time can be or should be used in the construction of other programs written at a later time. - Wikipedia 3.2.3 Test your code systematically 3.3 Asking questions: Minimal reproducible example 3.3.1 How to create a minimal reproducible example References Project-oriented research Computational reproducibility “Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing” by PLOS Project Management with RStudio by Software Carpentry Initial steps toward reproducible research by Karl Broman Version control Version Control with Git by Software Carpentry The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science by Kieran Healy Writing code Style guides R Google’s R style guide R code style guide by Hadley Wickham The tidyverse style guide by Hadley Wickham Python Google Python Style Guide Code Style by the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python Asking questions "],
