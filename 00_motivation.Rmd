# Computational thinking {#motivation}

## Why computational thinking 

> If social scientists want to know how to work smart and not just hard, they need to take full advantage of the power of modern programming languages, and that power is automation. - [Jae Yeon Kim](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/blog/why-teaching-social-scientists-how-code-professional-important)

## Computational way of thinking about data 

### Structure 
- Structured data (Excel spreadsheets, CSVs)
  - Tidy data 
- Semi-structured data 
  - HTML/CSS: Websites 
  - JSON/XML: APIs

### Dimension
- Low-dimensional data (n > p)
  - Survey, experimental, and administrative data 
- High-dimensional data (n < p)
  - Text, speech, image, video, etc. 

### Size 
- Data fit in your laptop's memory 
- Data don't fit in your laptop's memory (=big data)

## Computational way of thinking about research process

Computational tools and techniques make ... 

- Doing traditional research easier, faster, scalable, and more reproducible
  - Data wrangling 
  - Modeling 
  - Visualization 
- Documentation and collaboration easier, faster, scalable, safer, and more experimental 
  - Dynamic reporting (markdown)
  - Version control system (Git and GitHub)
- Collecting and analyzing large and complex data possible 
  - Digital data collection (API and web scraping)
      - Building a data infrastructure (SQL)
  - Machine learning
