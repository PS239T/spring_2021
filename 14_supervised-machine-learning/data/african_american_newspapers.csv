Kermit Scott, associate national director of CORE, explained that ""capital leakage"" is one of the main problems in the black ghetto. In Harlem, for example, 80 per cent of the business is white-owned, and as a result, Scott said, most of the residents' money goes out of the community. ""The new black economic program,"" Scott said, ""will create wealth in our communities, not just jobs alone, but jobs and capital.""Donald Simmons, economic consultant to CORE, has been instrumental in designing the new economic thrust of the organization. ""Straight up business"" he said, ""may be the thing to do before the whole place blows up."" Simmons stated that legislation has been introduced in Congress, a bill called the Community Self-Determination Act, which will complement black economic development. The twofold purpose of the legislation is to establish the apparatus for setting up economic corporations in ghettos, and to establish a secondary banking system that will help blacks get credit.The national director of CORE, Wilfred Ussery, commented on the group's concept of black separatism. ""We don't see enough energy in the United States to bring blacks and whites together,"" he said. Scott noted that CORE was not adopting a policy of segregation, ""a system where one group controls the goods, flow and life style of another group-control from without."" Rather, he said, ""we are talking about a separatist society, which implies that where blacks predominate they control."" The whole society, he concluded ""has expressed itself as one that is not inclined toward integration.""Photo (KERMIT SCOTT, WILFRED USSERY AND DONALD SIMMONS)","1968",1,0
"6","",1968-12-18,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," The Lowell Junior High school fire that caused $75,000 in damages to that all-black Oakland junior high school justifies the indignant concern that Negroes in Oakland are showing at this senseless act that has robbed the Negro children who attend this school of their much needed classroom space and has interrupted their education. The nature of the fire points towards arson as its origin, and if this be the case, and it appears that it is, every Negro in Oakland should make an effort to aid the police in apprehending the person or persons who committed this foul deed. During the last year, several Oakland schools have been subjected to sporadic fires, the major portion of which have been deliberately set by students or non-students who intend to disrupt the educational processes of this city.There are some who would call these persons ""militants."" We believe they must be branded as stupid, inconsiderate criminals who must be apprehended and brought to justice as their deeds not only destroy the educational facilities of this school district, of which 68 percent of the students are minorities, but also place in jeopardy the lives of teachers, administrators, and students who attend these educational institutions.Black people throughout the city recognize that education on all levels is the most important asset any Negro student can have. It is difficult to believe that anyone could reason that the destruction of our school facilities by fire could aid in the education of our children.Because of the frequency of the fires in the Oakland schools last year the insurance companies covering the schools cancelled their policies. This insurance has been reinstated with a $25,000 deductible, which means that in this instance, fire insurance will pay $50,000, approximately, but the first $25,000 of damage must be paid out of an already tight school budget. It is conceivable, too, that if the experience of the district with reference to fire damage is continued, the insurance companies covering the district will cancel their insurance completely.Every possible effort should be made to apprehend the culprit and prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law. There is no possible rationale or justification for public property being destroyed intentionally by arson and no logical person can justify this act. The time has come for men of reason and sound judgment to make an all-out effort to generate the kind of community support for the school district that will result in the capture of the persons responsible for such offenses as the fire that destroyed a major portion of Lowell Junior High. This must be done if the black children of Oakland are to receive the education that they are entitled to.It is the recommendation of this paper that the School District post a reward for the person aiding in the capture of the guilty person or persons.","1968",0,1

One of the men ordered $2 worth of gas and then walked over to an attendant, Leonard George, and asked for change of a quarter. When George opened the cash register the man produced a gun and ordered him to turn over the cash, a total of $80.He then walked back to the truck, peeled two dollars off the roll, paid the gas attendant for the gas and the truck drove off. George and manager Gene Goodwin, who was sitting in the office, both got the license number of the vehicle and they phoned police. The truck entered the freeway, then got off the Seventh St. off-ramp and drove down Seventh St.Shot in the gunfire were Lt. Darmott Creedon, 51, Sgt. Robert Flynn, 51, and Inspector Michael O'Mahoney, 51. Creedon and Flynn, who had just left the Hall of Justice, spotted the truck and reported by radio that they were going to stop it.Both officers got out of the patrol car, Flynn stepping to the front of the van and Creedon to the rear. A moment later, Flynn was shot, felled by two bullets. Creedon was hit next and went down, managing, however, to get two shots off.A second patrol car which pulled out of the Hall of Justice rear parking lot moments later heard Creedon's radio call for help and was at the scene in a minute. In it were officers Bill McCool and and John Hanafin and Inspector O'Mahoney.""I saw three men get out of the truck and I ordered them to halt, but they fired at me and ran,"" said O'Mahoney.Hanafin ran to the rear of the truck with his drawn revolver. ""Five men in the back started to get out of the truck and I covered them with my gun and ordered them back in and locked them in,"" Hanafin said.Meanwhile, the three fleeing men had run up a dead end alley and surrendered to the three officers. Only one weapon was found, a 9mm automatic. At the scene were six expended shells from the weapon. Inside the truck, police found three clips of .30 caliber bullets for a carbine and other loose ammunition.Dozens of officers, who arrived on the scene in minutes, rounded up the eight men and took them to the Hall of Justice. The three men on the front seat, one of whom fired the weapon, were identified as William Lee Brent, 37, an ex-convict, Raymond Lewis, 28, also an ex-convict; and Samuel Napier, 26. The men in the rear were Richard Brown, 27, also an ex-convict; Wilfred Holiday, 35, John Bowman, 21; Harill Hill, 17; and Lennox Merritt, 16.All were booked for investigation of robbery and three counts of assault with intent to commit murder.In City Prison Tuesday night, Brent, who witnesses said was the man with the gun, collapsed and was taken to San Francisco General Hospital. Brent's collapse followed shortly after a woman called the jail and said she was his mother and that he was under the influence of narcotics.However, doctors at the hospital said Brent showed no evidence of having been under the influence of narcotics. A team of six inspectors headed by Inspectors Frank O'Leary and Ray Minkel, worked around the clock interviewing witnesses. Merritt and Hill, the juveniles, were in custody at the Youth Guidance Center. Police said they would seek to place against the suspects charges of conspiracy to rob and attempt to commit murder.","1968",0,1

Among these craftsmen were cabinet makers, weavers, coopers, pewter-, gold-, and silversmiths, and workers in wrought iron.Antedating the advent of photography and making up for the lack of trained artists, many sign and house painters took to painting the portraits of eager sitters, the article points out.

But through the generosity of patrons or abolitionist groups, many of these black artists were able to join white compatriots in studying abroad -- which was considered a necessity for serious artists.Robert S. Duncanson (1817-1872) was one of many black artists who was aided by the support of patrons. Duncanson was commissioned by Nicholas Longworth and other prominent citizens of his native Cincinnati to paint portriats and landscapes. His traits and landscapes. His paintings still adorn the Longworth mansion, now the Taft Museum.Duncanson traveled in Europe with the help of an abolitionist award and received the patronage of the Duchess of Sutherland and the Duchess of Sussex.A prominent artist who did not travel but won considerable praise as a regional painter was Edward Mitchell Bannister (1828-1901) of Providence, Rhode Island. The nineteenth century also produced Edmonia Lewis (ca. 1842 - ca. 1890), a well-known Negro sculptor who studied in the United States before traveling to Rome.Near the turn of the century, Henry O. Tanner (1859-1937) emerged as an outstanding artist of international acclaim, according to the magazine. Tanner received the Legion of Honor from the French government and eventually became absorbed in painting Biblical themes.The New Negro Movement, sometimes called the Negro Renaissance, came with the 1920s. This was a period of great social and intellectual ferment in which black communities produced dozens of literary-artistic magazines. For the first time in American history, a cultural racialism developed among Negroes and through the efforts of Negro scholar - aesthete, Dr. Alain L. Locke, a new appreciation of Africa and the ""ancestral arts"" was generated in the black literary-artistic community, the article points out.This spirit of cultural racialism was summarized by Negro poet Langston Hughes: ""We younger Negro artists intend to express our individual dark skinned selves without fear or shame.""","1968",1,0

NBC-TV got another low bow for moving in a democratic direction when the ""Catholic Hour"" presented ""Sing Freedom"", four freedom songs in memory of the late Dr. Martin Luther King. Gilbert Price was soloist and combined his vocal talent with the combined choirs of the Ebenezer Baptist church, Atlanta, and the Peloquin Chorale from the Cathedral of Providence. Ossie Davis added the piece de resistance as he read passages from the writings of Dr. King. James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Allen Ginsberg and Robert Penn Warren further added to the ever green memory of Dr. King through a literary evening at the Museum of Modern Art.

By the way, don't be surprised if ""Soul"" becomes a weekly NBC thing a la ""Laugh-In"". According to Friendly, ""Soul"" doesn't have a cause and isn't trying to prove anything.

European cities and even Oriental ones like Tokyo think nothing of having at least a half dozen or more major orchestras and several opera companies. Samuel's daring programming of seldom heard works and contemporary compositions provides stimulation to the curious concertgoer, the one yearning to hear more than only the tried and true.Last week's Oakland programs, the second of the season, provided brilliant contrasts. An early 20th century descriptive choreographic composition by Debussy, entitled ""Jeux - Poeme danse"" (Games - a poem danced), was followed by Mozart's fine C Minor Concerto with Czech pianist virtuoso, Rudolf Firkusny, as the capable and satisfying soloist. In the second half of the program, ""Mixtur for Orchestra, Sine Wave Generators and Ring Modulators"" by the controversial avant-garde composer, Karleinz Stockhausen, received its local premiere with the assistance of the Mills College Tape Music Center, five men dressed in long white doctors' jackets. Space does not permit a detailed analysis of this challenging contemporary production, and it needs to be seen and heard rather than read about! The wise and comfortful choice for the closing number was Beethoven's Symphony, No. 7 in A Major, and Samuel's reading of it was masterful, receiving long and fervent applause and bravos from the audience.W. Hazaiah Williams has kept his ""Today's Artist"" management going for 11 seasons and is to be commended for his valiant labors in presenting to the Bay Area artists of every color and nationality. Local artists should be especially grateful to him because of his efforts to promote and provide them with opportunities and outlets for public appearance. ""L'Opera Vive,"" which opened the current season, fell short of expectations, but this should not deter continued public support for the two remaining events of this 11th season of ""Today's Artists.""One of the world's finest artists, German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, sang to a packed house at the Masonic auditorium Sunday night.

Artist managements, like other American businesses, do not pass out ""freebies"" when they figure they don't need you, and this often includes the minority and weekly press. Sunday's audience rightfully included many black music lovers and artists, even Robert McFerrin, formerly of the Metropolitan Opera Co., now of Los Angeles.

Negro Councilman Billy Mills, who asked the City Council to urge RTD to put the plan into effect, regretted that it had, taken a year to bring it about. During last year's controversy over whether armed guards should ""ride shotgun"" on besieged routes, Mills proposed the elimination of money from transactions between drivers and riders. Instead, ""more sophisticated and expensive means were utilized,"" Mills noted. ""Two way radios and silent alarm systems cut robberies by about 50 percent.

""The Red Cross nurses do minor surgery, such as tooth-pulling and lancing of abscesses,"" he explained. ""The hospitals are too crowded with war casualties to accept people with minor complaints, and it's our job to handle them. After we won their trust, we found that people would rather have us treat them than go to a hospital anyway,"" Hollomon continued, ""because in Quang Ngai people still hold to the idea we had it this country for so long: that you go to a hospital only to die.""As a matter of fact, Quang Ngai hospitals are not pleasant places to be in. Maximum nursing care is eight hours a day - round-the-clock care is unknown.

I can remember cases where Vietnamese physicians, with no technical equipment to help them, have proven American doctors wrong, even through the American doctors had access to up-to-date diagnostic equipment.Hollomon was also impressed with the courage and cheerful spirit of the refugees in the camps. ""They are people who have seen the worst type of death all around them, yet they never seem to lose their courage or their sense of humor.""""It was tough working in a war-torn country,"" Hollomon conceded, ""and there were times when I asked myself what the heck I was doing there, but it's also challenging, and I have agreed to return for at least another six months.""Photo (HOLLOMAN EXAMINES YOUNG WAR REFUGEE)","1968",0,0

After making a pointed reference to Bradley in a speech at the University of Ilinois (see story elsewhere) when he said Los Angeles' problems with Negro police officers had been their quitting and going into the City Council, the Mayor returned to Los Angeles and set out today, just in advance of Bradley's announcement, for Europe.His scheduled return in two weeks would leave him more than enough time to file for the Spring race.OPEN RACEWho else will oppose Bradley in what is expected to be an open race will also develop before the deadline, the close of the first week in January.Bradley, who will be 51 next month, is serving his second term on the Council to which he was re-elected last year without opposition.Before going into politics, he spent a brief time as a lawyer and before that, put in 21 years on the Los Angeles police force, refiring with the rank of lieutenant and as night watch commander of the Wilshire Division which is in his councilmanic district, which is only one-third Negro. A native of Texas, he has lived in Los Angeles since his infancy and is a graduate of UCLA.In a press conference at which formal announcement of his candidacy will be made, Bradley is expected to say he runs ""not merely to oppose a tired administration which has lost its credibility with people,"" but because ""Los Angeles has reached a turning point."" He is convinced he can effect the reconciliation of rich and poor, white and black, which is vital to the city's progress, he will say.L. A. TIMES IS KEYThe race represents the largest serious political venture by a Negro in the country to date. Los Angeles is approaching three million in population.Key to the election is considered to be the direction taken by the Los Angeles Times, possibly the country's second most powerful daily paper, with which Yorty has had an apparently irreconcilable break over the past two years.Whether Bradley gets Times support or not depends on who else enters the race, a spokesman for the Negro councilman told The POST.A Democrat, Bradley is closely allied to outgoing House speaker Jesses Unruh who is expected to run for Governor in 1970. Unruh is not especially beloved of the Times which is said to be eying the Governor's seat, and possibly the Mayor's, for its publisher, Otis Chandler, and even for his wife, ""Buffie,"" who has been increasingly prominent as the force behind the erection of the Los Angeles Music Center and on the Board of Regents of the University of California.Married, Bradley is the father of two grown daughters.","1968",1,0

""Isn't it interesting,"" he went on, ""that when there was a black body hanging from every other magnolia tree in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, nobody said a word about law and order.""""Do you not find it politically absurd,"" he continued, ""that Richard Nixon would now be crying ""law and order"", yet that same Richard Nixon formed an unholy alliance with Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond and furthered stated he would appoint an attorney general who would not enforce the school segregation law."" This is law and order?Lomax criticized the moral duplicity of the nation. ""If we're going to have law it must be law for everybody. We must have order for everybody."" He went on to emphasize that law without justice is tyranny.Second political absurdity--our preoccupation with communism. Right and wrong are no longer the important words for us but rather whether something is communist or capitalist.""We weren't concerned about the freedom of the Vietnamese people as long as the French Christian had them under colonialism. But if white Russian communist puts them under colonialism, that's bad,"" he observed.He went on to say that if the American people are so concerned about freedom, why don't we invade South Africa and liberate the black people. ""If the white Christian puts you in slavery, 'groovy', but if its a communist, that's bad."" The danger, Lomax feels, is equating communism with total evil and equating our country and capitalism with total good.Third absurdity--the call, by such elected officials and candidates as Reagan, Rafferty and Nixon for ""a return to the great old days of morality."" A fair part of the American electorate will vote in November firm in the belief that somehow between Richard Nixon and George Wallace things will return to the state they were in when they grew up. ""Those great old days were days of abrasive and total hypocrisy,"" declared Lomax. He pointed his finger at the young white students and the black militant students who have correctly seen through this hypocrisy. ""It all boils down to a tissue of deliberate lies designed to keep black people in a state of subjugation and to keep young people in a slump.""In an aside on the Eldridge Cleaver debacle at the University of California he said the thing about the incident that the young people should resent is the assumption that they are stupid. He went on to emphasize, ""you want to hear everybody there is to be heard and have the moral ability to decide what you want to believe. The fear is that somebody might come and open up an accurate text of history,"" he added.In summing it up, Lomax declared that nothing of lasting importance is going to come out of the year 1968. ""This will stand as the inevitable silly season that every revolution must pass through.""The real question as Lomax sees it is whether the young white revolutionaries and black militants can establish a dialogue about the future.","1968",0,1

The law in question is Title II -- EMERGENCY DETENTION -- the second part of the McCarran internal Security Act. which was passed over President Truman's veto during the Korean War.Although no one has yet been incarcerated under this law, the suit requests nullification of the law because of its ""chilling effect"" on the First Amendment rights to free speech, association and redress of grievances. This basis was allowed in a Supreme Court decision favoring the Southern Conference Education Fund (Dombrowski case) -- the one organizational plaintiff in this case. The plaintiffs also feel that once the law is invoked they would be deprived of all constitutional guarantees of due process.The suit was initiated because of a growing public awareness and fear of the concentration camp law, following the publication in 1966 of ""CONCENTRATION CAMPS -- USA"" by Charles R. Allen Jr., which was commissioned, put out and distributed by the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties (CCCL).The plaintiffs are some of the leaders in sharp dissent with government foreign and domestic policies; they belong to the activist peace, black people's, student, civil rights, liberties and political minority organizations. Many have already suffered government and FBI harassment, court and Congressional committee actions, police confrontations and punitive jail sentences. They feel that they would be, in the eyes of the Administration, logical victims should the concentration camp law be invoked.

Pocos son los que dudan el hecho que Pele es el jugador mas fantastico de todos los tiempos en el futbol internacional. Recibe por su habilidad extraordinaria un salario de $341,000 cada ano de su equipo Santos, y gana un promedio de $1,250,000 dolares anuales.Su fortuna es aun mas afortunada, ya que no paga impuestos: El gobierno brasilero lo ha catalogado como ""recurso nacional"".En su pais natal, el nombre de Pele se encuentra en marcas de zapatos, camisas, pelotas, etc. Existe incluso una marca de leche con su nombre. Su fama y admiracion recorre los cuatro rincones del munod; es admirado por fanaticos y jugadores de igual manera; principes y artistas festejan siempre cuando tienen el honor de conocerle personalmente.Pele nacio en la pequena aldea de Tres-Coracoes cerca al puerto de Santos. Su padre fue un jugador de futbol en la ligas menores, ganando $4.50 por partido. Pele fue descubierto mientras jugaba en la calle por Valdamar Brito, un ex-jugador del equipo nacional del Brasil, quien encontro en Pele una ""gran Promesa"". No se equivoco.Trece anos mas tarde, es hoy en dia el rey del futbol. Su primer partido por su equipo Santos lo jugo cuando tenia solo 14 anos. A los 17 anos de edad, logro conseguir fama mundial al ser una de las figuras estelares en el equipo brasilero que gano el campeonato mundial de Suecia en 1958. En ese ano, fue catalogado por los expertos como ""uno de los diez jugadores de clase en el mundo.""Cuando cumplio 20 anos, la compania automovilistica Fiat de Italia, junto con tres equipos de la Liga Italiana, ofrecio $3,000,000 dolares por los servicios de Pele. Cuando la oferta fue rechazada, el grupo se preparo para darle la oportunidad a Santos de pedir el precio que quisieran.Fue entonces cuando el gobierno de Brasil intervino, y declaro a Pele como ""recurso nacional"", y que por lo tanto no podia ser vendido a ningun equipo extranjero.El presidente del Club Santos, Athie Cury, ha declarado que ha recibido mas de una docena de ofertas por Pele de 1 millon para arriba.En una partido en Santos, Pele fue lesionado ligeramente. Mientras tomaba un bano en el intermedio, un substituto fue anunciado por los parlantes. La reaccion fue violenta; mas de 30 mil personas invadieron la cancha y rehuzaron volver a sus asientos hasta que Pele regresara.En 1962, un problema de protocolo surgio cuando el Duque de Edinburg visitaba el Brasil, y pidio visitar a Pele. ?Era propicio para Pele ir a visitar ai Duque, o vice-versa? El Duque visito a Pele.Sobre el respecto, un diario comento: ""En el reinado del futbol, cuyo territorio comprende a todos los paises del mundo, el unico rey es Pele. Sobre Su Majestad solo el poder espiritual del cielo puede reinar.""En su vida como futbolista profesional, Pele ha anotado mas de 700 goles. En un solo partido, anoto un record de 8 goles.Cuando un reportero le pregunto a Pele si creyo alguna vez que llegaria a ser tan famoso dijo: ""No, lo unico que yo queria era ser un jugador de futbol.""En Santos, cada vez que juega, el estadio se llena. Las entradas reservadas son vendidas por $25 dolares. El resto de las entradas son vendidas a 60 centavos.

C. -- Failure of federal agencies to enforce civil rights legislation strictly has meant that Negroes have been denied an equal opportunity for economic advancement in 16 Black Belt counties of Alabama, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights indicated in a publication issued today.Entitled ""Cycle to Nowhere"", the commission's Clearing-house Publication No. 14 is based on sworn testimony at a public hearing in Montgomery Arpil 27 - May 2 where the agency collected information concerning denial of economic opportunity to Negroes in rural and non-metropolitan areas of Alabama. The hearing focused on 16 counties running in a belt from the Georgia state line on the East through Montgomery to Mississippi on the West.""Cycle to Nowhere"" was written for the Commission by Paul Good, author and specialist in civil rights reporting.In releasing the publication, Howard A. Glickstein, acting staff director of the Commission, said: ""This narrative account of our hearing this Spring in Montgomery shows how the failure of federal agencies to enforce civil rights legislation has prevented many Negroes from sharing the benefits of economic advancement in the South. As ""Cycle to Nowhere"" demonstrates the economic status of most Negroes in 16 Black Belt counties of Alabama has not changed much since the Commission held a hearing in Montgomery 10 years ago. Testimony at our hearing in 1968 showed that Negroes in those counties still are denied equal opportunity in farm programs, education, employment, and health and welfare simply because they happen to be black.ONLY ""HAPHAZARD"" CHECKS""Particularly shocking,"" continued Glickstein, ""was the testimony of representatives of major firms with millions of dollars in government contracts who indicated that the government made only haphazard checks on the equal opportunity requirements of those contracts. Their testimony also revealed instances of overt discrimination in employment and plant facilities on the basis of race.""Glickstein added that the Commission's Spring hearing was part of the agency's study of the issue of economic security as it affects Negroes, Mexican Americans, and other minorities in selected counties of 9 southern states. The study is expected to be completed in about a year.Testimony at the hearing in Montgomery indicated that patterns of discrimination in farm service, employment, health and welfare services, and education resulted in a cycle of poverty which was an all encompassing aspect of Negro life in Alabama.At the hearing, a Negro veteran of the military testified how he was demoted from Army ""sergeant to boy"" when he sought a job; black farmers told how they received discriminatory treatment from federally financed farm programs and some described how they were forced off land they had worked for years because they dared exercise their political rights; a white mayor told the Commission how he screened job applicants for a printing plant; Negro children described inferior educational opportunities; and a Negro father declared that he had to drive 40 miles to purchase a malted milk or humble himself to use a ""Colored Only"" entrance in his home town.FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE""The cycle of poverty extends from cradle to grave, often a journey of only a few hours for black infants in a state where Negro infant mortality is two and sometimes three times that of white,"" the publication states. ""For those who survive, the cycle continues through a youth of shack-living, of under-nourishment and segregated under-education with their inevitable by-products of poor health and scant learning, and then years of adulthood eked out on welfare for mothers while for young men there are careers pushing brooms, pumping gas, and scraping meager yields from another man's land. The ways that discrimination works are varied but all are variations on a single theme: Keep the Negro in his place or force him to flee.""The cycle of poverty remains unbroken in spite of the fact that federal law exists to break it at nearly every point, according to the publication. ""Where there is partial enforcement of civil rights laws in areas like voting, dramatic results are sometimes produced. But implementation is more often indifferent than stringent, particularly when those laws inpinge on the course of corporations or challenge the vague monoliths called power structures.""Since the hearing, ""Cycle to Nowhere"" reports, federal government agencies such as the Government Printing Office, General Services Administration, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance have investigated allegations of discrimination which were voiced during the hearing against Alabama-based firms holding Government contracts. ""Concerned agencies must don 10 league boots if significant progress is going to be made. In field, factory, and classroom, black lives are being denied fulfillment each day that federal law, designed to make society free and fair for all, is broken by public and private enterprise.""The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is an independent, bipartisan factfinding agency created by Congress in 1957.

Christmas gift selection poses the same problem each year for businessmen -- what to give customers and associates. In fact, it wasn't too long ago that gift-giving was shunned by many businessmen as a questionable practice.Thanks to some guidance by wives and secretaries, however, times have changed according to Robert C. Rollings president of the Specialty Advertising Association Nearly 70 million business gifts will be purchased during 1968 at a total cost of $400 million, with the bulk of buying done during the Christmas season.Rollings says women have influenced the trend during the past several years toward less costly, more meaningful gifts. Today, more gifts are being selected which the whole family can enjoy, rather than the more traditional office-oriented items.Business gifts are being given as a personal gesture to say ""thank you"" to customers and associates. Rollings sees gift-giving as a custom similar to many other gestures of goodwill performed by businessmen throughout the year Luncheons, birthday cards, and social events such as golf outings are used by businessmen to show appreciation.Businessmen worry more over gifts than any other personal business gesture. As a result, busy executives depend on wives and secretaries more than ever for gift ideas. Many even depend on the women to select, purchase, wrap and send the gift--unless it is to be presented personally.Rollings advised that women can help most by keeping a watchful eye on the calendar. Businessmen often find themselves with too little time remaining to select a proper and meaningful gift before Christmas.A reminder far enough in advance will help make the rescue look like a routine operation.","1968",0,0

He has been unable to learn who the leadership of the boycott is and feels that it is coming from outside the community and that the community's youth is being ""duped"" into participating, he said as he urged his fellow commissioners to attend meetings of the boycott committee and try to ""clarify"" information and ""disprove false information"" being circulated in the Richmond community.This view was shared by Commission chairman Hans Shaper, who said that when he asked principals what would happen if the boycott committee's demands were met, he was told the ""boycott would continue anyway.""ORGANIZATION ""NEBULOUS""Shaper urged discussions of issues between the boycott leadership and the downtown merchants.

Smith stated.However, Commissioner R. Sawyer insisted that ""police patrol is a necessity and is assigned according to need - the area that generates the most calls receives the greatest patrol,"" he said. Officer Isabelle further reported that he has discussed the problem with both sides and found the police cooperative about ""resolving matters without major difficulties or confrontation ... with the Black Panthers. However, there remain feelings of mutual apprehension,"" he said.Officer Isabelle reported on the interviews of residents of Richmond following the June riots.

Cecil Williams, associate pastor of San Francisco's Glide Memorial United Methodist church.The movement has already yielded ""solid results in terms of greater status for Negroes in church operations,"" says Cornell.Charging that racism pervades the churches, Negro clergymen cite the ""inequality of power"" as the most pervasive issue.""The fundamental root of human injustice in America,"" Cornell quotes from the official statement of the National Committee of Negro Churchmen, is the disrespect of white men for the Negro personality and community, and the disrespect of Negroes for themselves.""A new Negro pressure bloc in Christian churches demands a large share of ""ecclesiastical power,"" Cornell writes in the December issue of Together magazine.DISENCHANTED WITH WHITE PATERNALISMHe attributes the black power demands to disenchantment with white domination and paternalism.Major pressure groups are: Black Methodists for Church Renewal, the Coordinating Committee of Black Lutheran Clergymen, the Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, Black Churchmen of the American Baptist Convention, Union of Black Clergymen and Laymen of the Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ Ministers for Racial and Social Justice, Black Caucus of the University Christian Movement, National Black Sisters, and the National Committee of Negro Churchmen.The Associated Press religion editor reports that most Negro Christians are concentrated in six Negro denominations; with a combined membership of around 11 million. He adds that about 1.6 million others are in predominantly white churches, of which the United Methodist Church leads with 374,000.The United Methodist Church, at its general conference last spring in Dallas, voted to invite all three Negro Methodist bodies, African Methodist Episcopal, Christian Methodist Episcopal, and African M. E. Zion, to merge with it. They have about 2.4 million adherents.SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSIONS WONThe Negro churchmen have wrested substantial concessions from several demonations, said Cornell.United Methodists have set up a $29 million Fund for Reconciliation ... to foster ""genuine racial inclusiveness in policy-making and appointments.""Black Methodists for Church Renewal have the support of the white reformist Methodists for Church Renewal.The American Baptist Convention is taking steps to put more Negroes in administrative positions and has agreed to appoint a Negro associate general secretary.The 180,000-member Unitarian-Universalist Ass'n has voted to give its Black Affairs Council a free hand and has appropriated a $250,000 annual budget for this group representing its 1,500 Negro members.Especially in Methodism Cornell notices insistence upon ""full racial equality in leadership positives.""The 283 black clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal church call for a ""complete examination"" of that body's executive structure, liturgy and hymnody to ""more fully reflect and respond to the needs"" of black members.""Negroes themselves must determine policy in programs for their own progress and must have power over them,"" Cornell was told by Dr. Elder G. Hawkins of New York City, former moderator of the United Presbyterian Church and a leader of the National Committee of Negro Churchmen.Negro clergymen want no ""uplift"" from outsiders, says Cornell.Cornell said that integration as laid out by whites was ""demeaning to blacks,"" for it suggested ""that they take on white culture, thereby repudiating their own and despising themselves for it.""""RACELESS CHURCH""The Rev. Henry H. Mitchell, Baptist minister of Santa Monica, says, ""The white man will have to become integrated into black culture"" to achieve the ""raceless church.""Dr. Vincent Harding, Negro historian of Spelman College, Atlanta, told Cornell that the Christian black power movement is ""the beginning of true corporate health and integrity"" which he deems essential for interracial community.""We need to redefine integration,"" said the Rev. Woodie W. White, Detroit Methodist. ""If it means white people hold all the power, we're not buying it. If we can come together as equals, we're for it.""The president of Benedict college in Columbia, S.C., the Rev. Benjamin F. Payton, an organizer of the National Committee of Negro Churchmen, said, ""Our definition of black power is the power to participate. We will not be cowed or intimidated.""The Rev. Joseph E. Lowry, Birmingham, Ala., Black Methodist, wonders if some whites are afraid of black power because they fear that Negroes want to do with it what has been done with white power.""Black power is simply a transitional term as we move toward soul power -- the power of God moving among men,"" he said.","1968",1,0

C. All Randolph doesn't know about farming, he knows where to go and get. For example:""I don't put all my eggs in one basket,"" says Randolph. ""Two things have helped me most in my farming operation-conservation and diversification.""When I bought this 200 acre farm, many people told me I'd never pay for it because there was too much steep land; and erosion had been active in most fields for several years.""A Soil Conservation Service technician helped him plan and apply a water disposal system on his cropland. Constructing terraces, he seeded Fescue and Sericea on land too steep for row crops.Randolph, an ex-tenant farmer, also discovered that terraces on his farm needed rebuilding, the soils needed lime and fertilizer, and fences and . . . to buildings were also needed.""Because we had a big . . . to do,"" he said, ""I started taking advantage of the Agricultural Conservation Programs."" Randolph now participates in the Agricultural Conservation Program and feed grain programs administered by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service office, and is a Soil Conservation District cooperator. ""The Soil Conservation Service helped me develop a soil and water conservation plan for my farm, and now I'm improving my land and keeping it on the farm instead of letting it wash away"" he says.NOW OWNS THREE TRACTORSRandolph's farm operation is one of the most modern in the county. When he bought the farm all tillage work was done with mules. He now owns three tractors and uses them to do all the land preparation, planting, and cultivating for 45 acres of cotton, 17 acres of wheat 8 acres of corn, and 8 acres of oats. Grain is harvested with a combine that he also owns. In addition to cotton and some grain that is grown for cash, he feeds out 15 head of hogs each year that he slaughters for both home use and sale.Another farm enterprise that provides additional income is a sawmill. Randolph and his sons operate during the slack work season on the farm. Off-farm income is also picked up each year during the winter months. Randolph and one of his sons are accomplished brick masons.Another accomplishment the Randolphs are proud of is the education of their 11 children. Two, W. S. and Inez Randolph have A. S. degrees from Morris college and Allen university. W. S. is a school teacher and minister in Sumter County, S. C. Miss Randolph is a school teacher in Washington D. C. Another daughter is a student at Morris college.Mr. and Mrs. Randolph attribute their success to the fact that their family has always worked together, and they believe in ""doing a man a favor"" whenever they can.As for long range plans, Randolph intends to increase the grassland on his farm under the Appalachian Program, and to gradually grow into beef cattle farming. Like most farmers, he feels that he cannot compete with industry in the labor market.""My boys can make more money off the farm than they can working here with me. I used to grow 65 to 70 acres of cotton... I've got to replace cotton with something that requires less labor.""","1968",0,0

"51","Lomax, Almena",1968-12-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," SPECIAL -- The sociologist who coined the theory of Negro male ""emasculation"" and thereby committed possibly the greatest single provocation of Negro violence of the entire Negro revolution of the past four years was chosen this week by President-Elect Richard M. Nixon to be his Cabinet officer in the newly created office of Urban Affairs and his close advisor on city problems, which in the language of the day, means the problem of what to do with, and about, the Negro.The incoming President's choice is former bartender, admitted son of a rootless drunken newspaperman, and thus the symbol of the Negro's ancient rival, the poor white, Daniel P. Moynihan, one-time under-secretary of Labor under President Johnson, and the man who, hitting on a neat phrase which offered a capsule explanation for the stubborn Negro problem, parlayed it into riches, a reputation as an ""urbanologist"" and the chairmanship of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Joint Center for Urban Affairs.In introducing the tall, pulpy Irishmen, a Tulsa, Okla, native, to newsmen, Nixon emphasized that his role would be more than that of a Cabinet officer, that he would sit on his right hand with regard to urban affairs. He also said that Moynihan was at first reluctant to take the job.Also addressing the newsmen in a televised news conference, Moynihan said the Urban Affairs post in the Cabinet was new because the ""urban problem is er-ah- a new problem with us.""In a study made for President Johnson and forming the basis of Johnson's address before the Commencement of Howard University two years ago, Moynihan asserted that white prejudice had accomplished the emasculation, or had destroyed the manhood, of Negro males.He described the Negro community as a Welfare-subsidized matriarchy, with the Negro male role largely that of a stud, as much a charge of the matriarch as the children who therefore lacked a strong father figure, or male image, to look up to.In another burst of imagery last year, Moynihan conceded that the U. S. Census of the Harlems of the nation was probably wrong and that there were hundreds of thousands; of shadowy male figures fading in and out of Negro homes, just in time for the Welfare check, mealtime and bedtime, but just ahead of the social case worker.Both theses of Moynihan's were greeted in the Negro community with shock, dismay, and anger, and Moynihan is, without a doubt and to his certain knowledge, one of the white men most hated by Negroes who know his name and reputation.As an index of the direction the Nixon administration may be headed, Moynihan, deeply distressed by the riots, took to the public press last year to state that kindness and understanding, desegregation and poverty war having failed to 'pacify' the Negro, the only choice left to the white man was to turn right, vote Republican, and turn his back on the social welfare measures of the past 8 years.","1968",0,1

Hardly a day goes by without another statement crossing our desk from government and industry officials.And we see some results - Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y. - and a dozencities already are able to point with pride to black owned businesses arising as a result of the activity in this field. A recent ad from General Electric pictured three beautiful black capitalists that General Electric proudly pointed to as an example of their cooperation to help establish such enterprise.Here in Sacramento Lt. Governor Finch called a meeting of bankers, businessmen and black businessmen to set into motion an effort in this direction under the leadership of the Urban Coalition. We were impressed by the turn out at the meeting and equally impressed with the legislation already enacted to ease the way for black owned businesses which came as a result of almost unanimous bi-partisan support in the legislature.It is clear that the climate does exist for the emergence of successful black owned businesses in our community. We trust that many will seek to take advantage of the facilities already in existence for this purpose. We believe that Negroes will cooperate in every way possible with all efforts in this direction.We are somewhat dismayed, however, that many of the press releases, many of the speeches, and particularly the legislation enacted in Calif., AB 109 and AB 1046 don't quite hit the mark. They're good as far as they go but somehow the legislation and the various programs are aimed at black owned ghetto businesses. We have no quarrel with the concept of our people. As a matter of fact most of the businesses owned by Negroes in the United States serve the Negro community, but this should not be our only objective, nor should it be the objective of those in the white community who desire to make restitution for the isolation forced upon us these many years.We have a right to be, we ought to be, in the mainstream of American life, and that means that Negro business must operate in the general community. We see no reason why we shouldn't own and operate factories, wholesale and distributing companies, as well as retail and service establishments, and inevitably we will.","1968",1,0

Man is the only animal to whom God has given the gift of speech. With a voice, man can say to his beloved, ""I love you."" With his voice he can sing the praises of his God. He can make his wishes known to his God. He can make his wishes known to his fellowman, he can speak his appreciation to those who have been a blessing to him.He can raise that voice in prayer to God. He can use it to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ. But, above all, let us think of the voice of Jesus. It must have been rich and full of vibrant.One day He got into a boat and pushed out from the shore and spoke to the people. They could hear Him well over the sound of the lapping waves. In revelation, we read that ""His voice was as the sound of many waters. But there is something more important than the sound of the voice, it is what you say with that voice. Yes one day the Pharisees sent officers to arrest Jesus, but they came back empty handed. When they were asked whey they had not arrested Him, the officers said, it was the way He talked. He said such wonderful things. Never did man speak as He speaks. Jesus said many marvelous things in the long, long ago.He still says the same thing today and forever. The truths that He proclaimed 2000 years ago are just as true and appreciated today.Jesus said, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind.Make a list of these things and the people that you love. Where do you put God? God should be at the top of the list. When He is there everything else will fall into its right place. We can hear His voice saying ""come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.""May God Bless You.","1968",0,0

"61","",1968-09-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," This is the last of a series of articles we have published for the bride elect who is organized, and wants the perfect wedding, with the least amount of effort.In preparing newspaper announcements for your wedding, be sure to include when, where and by whom the ceremony will be performed. Also, where the reception will be; who will give you in marriage; a description of your gown, headdress and flowers; names of best man and ushers; description of attendants dresses; where you and the groom will live.Have a leisurely breakfast, and your day-so carefully planned - is off to a glorious start. Absolutely everything has been done and will be perfect, so relax and enjoy yourself.Today's wedding gowns follow current fashion trends, with news in cut, trim or fabric. Where formerly a bride would choose a gown with a long cathedral train for a cathedral wedding, today she may wear a floor-length dress with a long veil which often is trimmed to match the dress and sometimes may double as a train.This is proper for any type of wedding. Gowns jeweled with ""pearls"" and crystals may be worn daytime or evening. However, elaborate gold and silver shimmery fabrics look better for evening.The number of attendants and the men's attire determine whether a wedding is formal or informal.On your ride to the church smooth your gown under you. And unless the car is spotless, line it with a sheet. Many churches have rooms where the bride and her attendants may dress, thus eliminating wrinkles.Have someone ""start"" your train as you go up the aisle. It should be held up off the floor at arm's length, billowed with air and then allowed to sink down, to float after you.If you are wearing long gloves, take the stitching out of the ring finger so that the ring can be slipped on your finger during the ceremony without removing your glove.Anchor your headdress with pins to avoid tipping when your maid of honor lifts the veil or friends press around.Duties of Bride's AftendantsHelp the bride in any way they can. Entertain her at showers, luncheons. Be at the bride's home at appointed time and dress there or before, whichever the bride prefers. Be ready for photographs, if desired, one hour before the service begins.The maid or matron of honor assists with the bride's bouquet, veil and train during the ceremony, signs the marriage certificate, and helps her change to traveling clothes.Groom's Check ListBuy engagement ring. Draw up his wedding guest list and see that his family-makes out theirs. Invite friends to act as his best man and ushers.Choose his wedding present for his bride. Select the wedding ring. This should be chosen with the bride and should match the engagement ring, if there is one. While the engagement ring is not engraved on the inside, the wedding band usually is, with the groom's initials first and the date. On the wedding day the groom entrusts the wedding band to his best man before the ceremony.Get the marriage license. Check state rules about time requirements. It should be obtained several weeks before the wedding and given to the best man the day of the wedding.Correct ApparelHe should check the wardrobe rules for the kind of wedding he will have, give this information as well as a time schedule to the ushers, and consult them to be sure they will be correctly dressed. To be sure of having identical ties and gloves if the wedding is formal, the groom usually provides them for his ushers and best man.Bachelor DinnerThis is traditionally given by the groom for his best man and ushers, although his other close friends may be invited. This should take place several days before the wedding so that it will not interfere with the rehearsal dinner or family parties.The groom must be sure to notify his attendants as to the hour and place of the rehearsal.Decide whether or not to kiss his bride at the alter - and tell her.Provide the clergyman's fee. Be sure that he and bride sign the wedding certificate and that it is safely put away before they leave on their honeymoon.Best Man's DutiesThe best man should take charge of the ushers and brief them on special seating arrangements at the wedding rehearsal. He should call for and accompany the groom to the church, and wait with him in the vestry, at least 15 minutes before the ceremony begins.

On August 10, 1968, Mr. Walter Kassis, one of the owners of Stop-N-Shop Stores was contacted about his hiring practices. Mr. Kassis said that the Stop-N-Shop Markets would hire in the fall and would consider seeking minorities employees. A follow-up letter was sent to Mr. Kassis after our conversation with him. There never was any real commitment on his behalf and nothing was done.People of the Community, Look and See! And ask yourself this question. An Honest Question, from what I have observed, are the Kassis Brothers and Stop-N-Shop Markets fair in their practices of employment in regards to Black People?We of UEO ask your indulgence for this once to shop elsewhere until our negotiations come to an agreement. To some people this may be somewhat of an inconvenience. There are those who cannot shop at all and why? Because they cannot find good jobs.Stop-N-Shop Markets and the Kassis Brothers are willing to take the people's money (Black people's money too) then by all means they should be willing to hire Black People and those of other minority groups. People of minority races support them, why should they not support us. The Kassis Brothers can help, but they will not.

John 2:11.INTRODUCTION: A central stream of truth runs through the letters of John as he relates the doctrine of Christ. Strong emphasis is placed on both His humanity and His divinity. He was truly God and truly man. This teaching was designed to refute a part of the heresy of gnosticism which holds that if Jesus were truly God, He could not be truly human. Our lesson affirms the historical fact that Jesus, the Son of God, came in the flesh. John declares in the opening verses of the first letter that he heard, saw, and touched Jesus in the flesh. His vigorous effort to instruct and warn the Christians was motivated by the fact of his physical union with Christ in the realm of the spirit.Lesson explained, I. CHRIST'S COMMANDMENTS, (2:7-11).John addressed his readers intimately as ""beloved."" It suggests an urgent appeal. I write no new commandment, because you have known it from the beginning of your Christian life. The new commandment of love, old as it now is in one sense, is, in another, new, as it ever gains fresh light and meaning. The darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth. Without the love of God in your heart, no one can walk in the light of God's truth. There is always danger of hate. It drives love away. It shuts out light. It poisons the heart. It dooms the soul. There are always stumbling blocks that may cause one to fall, but God's loving hand of mercy is always ready to lift us up again.II. CONVINCING EVIDENCE, (3:11-16).Love is a moral duty for the children of God, because it is the very essence of God's nature. John referred to Cain by way of contrast. He was not of God, but of the devil, and therefore slew his brother. A perfect realization of the filial relationship to God excludes sin. His seed remains in man, as the germinal principal from which his new life sprung. Hate is normal to the character of the unregenerated person, but love is natural for the Christian.","1968",0,0

Through the 225 bas relief figures, the artist passionately depicts the tragic and heroic struggles of the Afro-Americans beginning with their lives in Africa, the Black experience in America, and ending with the contemporary civil rights struggles in the South. An accompanying slide show with historical commentary by Mr. Ames has made the viewing more meaningful to the thousands of school children and interested groups of adults throughout the nation.Two exquisite tapestry-quilts designed by architect Ben Irvin, and pains-takenly created over a four-year veriod by the interracial History Quilt Club of Sausalito and Marin City some 15 years ago are also part of the exhibit.

"82","",1969-04-24,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," Some people say that Malcolm X started it, but as a matter of fact, it started a long time before him. I am referring to the opposition of black men to oppression in America. The desire for men to be treated as equal by their fellow men is one of the most time honored desires. Thousands of unnamed and unheralded black men during the 250 years of slavery died in this struggle for freedom and equality. The unrecorded history of slave rebellions and uprisings would afford historians sufficient material to fill an encyclopedia if all of these efforts had been recorded. The collapse of slavery was caused in the main by the inability of southern planters to contain the increasing restlessness of their slave population.With the final elimination of slavery as a recognized legal institution, there came on the scene of America black men who struggled for full participation in the economic, political and social life of America. Their early leaders are too numerous to mention. Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington and DuBois point up the early cadre for equality. In spanning the 100 years to the era of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young, we were ushered into the present social conflict.Those Negroes who were fortunate enough to come on the scene and participate in what appears to be the end of the struggle for legal and social recognition of black people in America faced the responsibility of separating fact from fiction. In the early days the problem was an easily definable one, mainly concerned with supporting black people in their struggle for equal rights and as against white people who attempted to deny their rights to them.It was easy then to make judgments as to who was right and wrong. At this point in time and history, however, Negroes and white people alike have the responsibility to use mature judgment in determining who is right or wrong on any given issue. The incident of race must be in the eliminated from this decision. The question that must be answered by all in the present context of the social struggle and in the educational and political revolution sweeping the country, is who has the greatest merit on this or that particular issue. Black students who attempt to take universities from black administrators and to run them for their purposes are as wrong as white students who attempt to grind universities to a halt by their disruptive and unlawful acts. It is wrong for black so-called militants to go on campuses as was the case in UCLA and shoot and kill other black militants in a fight for control of Negro student activities. These black students cannot be protected in the context that their acts are justifiable in the struggle for human decency.The rising incidence of crime that is sweeping the black communities of our central cities cannot be tolerated or condoned by any citizen, least of all by the black citizens who are the victims of these criminals. Negro students who want to pursue their education in some sense of order have a right to accuse black students who prevent them. They are just as much his enemy as the bigoted white man in the south who unlawfully attempts to deny Negro students their right to an education there.As we observe the struggle between social, educational and economic forces in the country today, the individual has the responsibility of choosing sides with the good guys as against the bad guys. The color does not help much in this determination. This is as it should be, and is as it has been from time immemorial. No race has a corner on the good and the bad guys, as is evidenced by the fact that in the war between the states white men killed white men. In the Spanish Civil War Spaniards killed Spaniards. In today's picture, black Nigerians are killing black Nigerians. History tells a continuing story of man's inhumanity to man. Race and religion have never been a determining factor in these human weaknesses. The time has come when we in America must accept this human failing as an established fact and deal with the issues without considering color. For a mature man, this does not come as a difficult task, but for the undisciplined and the immature it is not so easy. In fact, they may not want to accept it.If this becomes the case, and it appears that it will be, it will be necessary for the good guys then to impress their will upon the bad guys. With the issue joined on this consideration, it will then be possible for sanity to be returned in the present social struggle.","1969",1,1
"83","Berkley, Thomas L",1969-09-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," CENTER FOR URBAN BLACK STUDIESLabor Day seemed like as good a day as any to look up the Rev. Hazaiah Williams, President of the Berkeley School Board and Director of the Center for Urban Black Studies, located at 2465 LeConte Avenue, Berkeley. I hadn't seen Hazaiah since he returned from the funeral of his father, the Rev. Hazaiah Williams, Sr. in Detroit, and because he has been fairly quiet, as far as I was concerned he was up to some good. He had invited me on several occasions to visit his Center for Urban Black Studies at the Graduate Theological Union where, as he says, ""the center is providing the context for thorough theological training relative to urban and minority problems and developing a new articulation of theological concern within the minority community."" I wan't in a position to argue with him about this concept, not completely understanding what he was doing. I thought it would be best for the publisher to drop in and see what was going on.I must say it was an experience. Hazaish, along with his colleagues, the Rev. H. Eugene Furlow and the Rev. Hector E. Lopez and his administrative secretary Mrs. Lolita R. Rivers, are directing one of the most exciting experiences in religious education in any urban American center today.Recognizing that the black clergyman finds himself face to face with almost impossible problems as he struggles to pastor for his people, the Rev. Williams says the primary focus of the center will be given to assisting non-degree black minority clergymen. These men, some of whom have had little formal training, will be offered a theological education provided by one of the member schools of the GTU (Graduate Theological Union), and at the end of a prescribed period of time an earned certificate will be conferred upon those completing the program.Some of the subjects now offered by the Center for Urban Black Studies are: The Bible As It Relates to the Oppressed People, Black Minority Theology, The Culture of the Black Church, Black Minority Family and Its Relation to the Black Minority Church, Blackness as a Discipline, and Styles of Preaching and Communication in the Black Tradition.Not only does the Center address itself to the less learned and scholarly ministers, but it has a graduate division. The Center will provide an opportunity for graduate students to study in the specific areas of urban and black experiences. Similar courses to that of basic education will be developed but geared for graduate education, the Rev. Williams explained.I was particularly keen about the whole opportunity presented by this new thrust in black theology. With the establishment of this Center for Urban Black Studies it seems that the black churches have come a full circle in the eastbay. I remember over 20 years ago an enthusiastic young black preacher came to my office wanting me to form a church for him. He is the Rev. Carl Anderson, who over a 20-year period has developed his great religious institution, the Oakland Missionary Baptist Church. At the same time along came the Rev. J. L. Richard, who put together the Evergreen Baptist Church. Even before them the Rev. Edward L. Stovall was laboring with his Progressive Baptist Church. These were the forerunners of the religious thrust in the community during and after World War II and these are only a few of many dedicated black ministers who have made such a meaningful contribution to the development of the eastbay.The Negro community, shepherded by over 350 churches in Oakland, Berkeley and Richmond, leans heavily upon this basic institution for stability and direction. In all segments of the community, these institutions give support and guidance to the black people. In Berkeley, the Rev. Alexander S. Jackson with his Church by the Side of the Road has long been laboring in this direction, as has the Rev. Floyd Herbert Dice with his great Bethel Missionary Church in East Oakland. Recognizing the validity of the black church movement in its articulation with the black community, it is exceedingly important that the Rev. Hazaiah Williams' Center for Black Studies receive the total support of the church community.NAMES IN THE NEWSBob Farrell, Administrative Assistant to Councilman Billy Mills of Los Angeles, dropped in to the office last week to pick up some back issues of The POST to take down to Los Angeles to show them what a real paper looks like.In addition to assisting Councilman Mills, Bob is working on his Master's Degree at UCLA Journalistic School and plans to do a special thesis on the black newspaper and its contribution to society.

"84","",1969-01-04,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," The angry blast of two black community figures last week against WACO and its recent suit in the Federal Court halting relocation and redevelopment in Western Addition A2 is unwarranted. To call the Western Addition Community Organization a ""willful group of self-seekers"" is a disservice to this grass-roots community organization which for many months has attempted to articulate to and negotiate with the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency the matter of relocation of displaced persons from Western Addition A2.Officials at HUD have repeatedly cautioned Justin Herman that continued federal participation in the A2 project depended upon the establishment of a meaningful relocation program. Justin Herman and the agency have done little more than establish paper facades to satisfy federal officials, while doing very little meaningful planning to arrest the fears of A2 residents who in many instances are refugees of relocation from Western Addition A1. If a meaningful relocation program is not forced upon the agency, these residents will be displaced persons when Western Addition A4 unfolds.The truth is that the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency has been insensitive to the needs of displaced persons in the black ghettos. Eons of time have wasted by WACO in attempts at negotiation with Justin Herman. The American system provides that the judiciary serve as a refuge for the oppressed at the hands of governmental tyranny. WACO should be commended for its utilization of the federal courts in efforts to protect its members from the implementation of inadequate relocation plans. For an attorney at law to condemn a private group of citizens for utilizing its constitutional right to obtain a federal court injunction is appalling. That a minister interested in African relief should be insensitive to the efforts of black citizens to obtain Western Addition relief is quixotic. That the attorney and the minister should weep for the hundreds of families ""now condemned to live in rat and roach-infested and dilapidated Western Addition slum dwellings"" is laudible. In all probability, however, motivated WACO to seek relief in the federal courts.While it is hazardous to impugn the motives of a single individual, it is an exercise in folly to arbitrarily interpret and condemn the motives of a community organization.","1969",1,1

"86","Clark, Wilford",1969-02-22,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," The Republic of Liberia, settled in 1822 by freed American black men and declared a republic in 1847, may be taken by us as an example of what most African countries are facing after independence.For decades Liberia, in partnership with the Firestone Rubber Company, depended almost entirely on the export of rubber for its economic life. Over the past decade, high grade iron ore, found in abundance in a number of sites in the country, freed Liberia from its dependence on rubber. In an optimistic flourish, the Liberian Government in 1962 and 1963 borrowed money to improve the port of Monrovia, build railroads, and prepare the country generally for exploiting its iron ore deposits.There was an almost limitless supply of the ores which sold then at $16 per ton. But by 1968 the price of iron ore, even the 68 per cent iron content ores found in Liberia, sold for only $6.45 per ton. So that while production and exports of iron ores increased from three million tons in 1962 to more than 20 million tons in 1968, it was a case of the country running fast just to stand still. But even more: Liberia's debts by 1968 amounted to more than $250 million that had to be serviced at a cost per year of $17.2 million. This would equal what was received for three million tons of iron ore.The money was borrowed from foreign banks, mainly in the United States. And the facilities which the money paid for has made it easy for the foreign companies, who are exploiting the ores, to get the ores to port and aboard ship. In the main the companies which are exploiting the Liberian ores are still producers -- United States Steel and Liberian American Mining Company, a combination of American, Swedish and Liberian capital. To the foreign companies, the price of iron ores is simply a bookkeeping operation; they are both exporters and consumers at one and the same time. They are getting cheap raw material for their fabrication operations and at the same time making it possible for the bankers to turn a handsome penny at the expense of black africans.Now Liberia is trying to get an extension of payments. This is the same as recasting a personal loan; the interest remains the same but by stretching out the payments, the amount paid per installment can be lower.Next year it is believed that Liberia can have the installment lowered to $14 million. But even this will not be low enough to make possible a balanced account. The government will still have to borrow in order to pay for the trade deficit.Liberian rubber is in a still worse condition, for natural rubber is being driven off the market by synthetics, as the UN has repeatedly warned. The United States, the largest producer of synthetic rubber, has reached the point in the world market that it can control international natural rubber prices by simply increasing its production of synthetics whenever there is a slight rise in natural rubber prices. Therefore, it can be said that the price of natural rubber will remain chronically low, and countries depending upon it for economic health are done for.Liberia was never a colony in the formal sense, yet it has the same economic characteristics as those countries in Africa which were. It was, and is, a source of raw materials for the rich white countries, and a market for their manufactured products. According to the United Nations Economic Bulletin for Africa Vol. VII, No 1 and 2, West African countries must import 18 per cent of their manufactured consumer goods and 100 per cent of heavy industrial goods from Europe and America.This is why the meeting of the Economic Commission for Africa, which just closed in Addis Ababa, adopted the slogan of ""self sufficiency."" Tom Mboya, Kenya's Minister for Economic Planning and Development, told the meeting that the debt burden had become so great for African countries that any advances made would be swallowed up by repayment. He must have had Liberia in mind.Mboya disagreed with the advice from the rich white countries that Africans and Asians should devote more attention to agricultural developments. While Africans and Asians were following this advice, he said, the rich countries were working to produce new crops and synthetics which would leave Africa without a market. He appealed to African leaders to explore again the spirit of nationalism, for it had ""stood the Africans in good stead"" during their independence struggles and might be decisive in th present economic struggles.But nothing argues more eloquently for the self reliance of African countries than the balance sheet of Liberia. Behind it is an educational system that educates only every third child and gives the average worker an income of just above $150 a year.It has taken Liberia 121 years to reach this figure. There must be a better way out for Africa than that.","1969",0,1

No one understood this better than Martin Luther King or took more foresighted means to blunt the violence and contain the struggle within our legal system.His tremendous influence for achieving legal and peaceful solutions in the early stages of a period of great potential violence was perceptively recognized in the award to him of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Clearly he foresaw the great potential danger which violence and hatred during this period posed for the country and its legal system and, therefore, for his people.""It may be said, then, that in a period of very dangerous transition, Martin Luther King was a major factor in persuading the law to recognize and to accommodate rationally to the transition and, hence, in preserving respect for the essential justice and practicality of our system of law.""It therefore seems singularly appropriate that a building for the teaching of the law should be named 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Hall'.""","1969",1,0

The marchers made a distinct effort to keep it ""cool"" and did not attempt to tear down the fence the University has erected around the park.Some 2000 National Guardsmen were on hand as well as 300 Berkeley police, Highway Patrolmen and Sheriff's deputies in case there was trouble. Medics were in the area to supply any medical assistance necessary.But none was needed, for there was no violence, only flowers and Spring-like playfulness.Barbed wire barricades that had been set up to keep the parade along its scheduled march were laced with daisies and other blossoms by the demonstrators and a few National Guardsmen even had flowers in their helmets.The marchers stopped along the way to create instant parks with rolled up sod, one of them directly in front of the People's Park from which the street people, as they are called, had been evicted.No injuries were reported and there were only two arrests: one of a 16-year-old runaway youth who was jailed for being drunk and a marcher who got so carried away that he disrobed himself.The demonstration marked the end to a relatively peaceful week in Berkeley. The City of Berkeley had attempted to mediate the dispute between the street people and the University administration by offering plans for two new parks, both in the south campus area near People's Park.Berkeley Mayor Wallace Johnson said at a City Council meeting, ""We can only hope that the resources of the university will somehow be mobilized to recognize the needs of all the people and do something about it.'The City Council voted 8-1 to ask that the National Guard forces be removed immediately from Berkeley, but Governor Ronald Reagan insisted that the city wanted the Guard to remain there.Gov. Reagan told a news conference that he would use ""whatever force was necessary"" to control the demonstration.

"94","Robertson, Gene",1969-11-01,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," Maybe there really is something to the old superstition that 13 is an unlucky number for it was at the 13th annual San Francisc Film Festival on Oct. 22 that an episode occurred which to some extent, marred its gala opening.I refer, of course, to the disgraceful, cheap publicity-seeking pie-throwing episode. It has already been highly publicized and I am, frankly, reluctant to give it additional publicity in as much as this is obviously what the so - called 'independent film-making group' from Sausalito, who perpetrated the stunt, so badly want. It does, however, warrant mention since I feel - and call me totally square, if you like - that while the piethrowing won international headlines, the publicity certainly wasn't of the type to help future festivals, which, up to this year, have never been marred by any such indefensible, inexcusable, totally childish pranks.This strikes me as doubly unfortunate since the 13th annual festival is, in my opinion, by far the best yet held. Not only are the films - in general, at least - far better than in past festivals but the entire festival is being handled, publicity-wise, by Jack Wodell Associates and my personal experience has been that there's thorough and wholehearted cooperation as compared to past years. I think both the festival officials - particularly Program Director Albert Johnson and Executive Chairman Claude Jarman. There are many others, I'm sure, who deserve praise and I hereby apologize for omitting their names. Actually there are many volunteers (ushers, etc.) who have so graciously and generously given their time that it would be impossible, space-wise, to list their names.The opening night's film, Stanley Kramer's ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria,"" lived up to all its favorable advance publicity. It was a delightful film (quite possibly Kramer's best and that's saying a lot inasmuch as Mr. Kramer has made many outstanding films). The film is a United Artists release but unfortunately the local office has no release date on the film locally. I have a feeling that it will probably be a Christmas film for United Artists. Both Anthony Quinn, who stars in the film and gives one of his best performances to date, and Virna List, who also stars but in a comparatively minor role, were present for opening night and I think it is to the credit of both that neither made long, drawn-out speeches. In fact, the only opening night speech that I would 'put down' would be that of Mayor Alioto. I join columnist Herb Caen in saying that the good mayor is carrying his ""Don't - cancel - your - subcription - to - Look"" joke just a little bit too far. We've all heard it umpteen times now and it certainly wasn't a fitting remark for a film festival opening. The Mayor may have a good case against Look magazine but I, for one, wish that he'd try it in court rather than in public addresses.I devoted half my ""On the Beam"" column to the film, ""Terry Whitmore, For Example,"" so I'm not mentioning it further in this article.In general, this year's film are far, far superior to previous festivals. Only one, I'd say, was an outright bore and that was ""More"" (an entry from Luxembourg.) There are many that should be mentioned in detail but space simply doesn't permit. I would, however, like to mention the entry from India, ""The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha,"" a lyrical fairy tale for adults. It had all the real magic, charm and wit that Walt Disney, with all his pink plastic fabrications, never once managed to evoke. Satyajit Ray has now created a masterpiece perhaps even greater than his film classic, ""The World of Apu."" Not a moment of it was less than superb.And certainly one of the major films was ""Deserters and the Nomads"" from Czechoslovakia. Begun before the Russians moved tanks into Prague last year, it weaves this event, along with others, into its powerful anti-warmessage. This is a film without mercy. The main character is Death, the theme is the total bestiality and carnage amongst men in times of war. Brilliantly done, it shows the ultimate world when the last people are gone and ends with the death of Death itself. It is an impassioned and harrowing film and a scathing denunciation of war.But to me, the highlight of the festival thus far has been France's entry, ""Z,"" which deals with the terrible political problems in Greece. The title is derived from the fact that Z stands (in Greek) for ""to live."" It stars Yves Montand and Irene Papas and, frankly, is one of the most engrossing films I've ever seen.I can only hope that ""Z"" will be soon shown commercially in this city.The festival will conclude this Sunday, Nov. 2, with the highlight of the day being the appearance of Gordon Parks, who is one of the New Directors being honored for his film ""The Learing Tree."" This will be at 4:00 p.m. Sunday.

"95","Nyoka, Justin V.J.",1969-09-20,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," Salisbury, Rhodesia -- Under the present political climate in Rhodesia, with determined inclinations towards the separation of races by the Rhodesian Front Government, the country's only university -- a multi-racial unistitution, has become an anachronism.There is speculation, even at official level, that the Government under pressure from those of its right - wing supporters, will close down the university and then open it later as a ""whites only"" institution.The University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established in 1957 by Sir Roy Wlensky's Federal Government as a premier place of learning to serve the Federation's three territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It was placed in Rhodesia's capital, Salisbury, which was also the capital city of the Federation.Its links as a college of the English universities of London and Birmingham has enabled Rhodesians of all races, including myself, to receive degrees from these universities. This link, until after the Rhodesian Government declared its UDI (unilateral declaration of Independence) in 1965, helped to attract academic and students from Commonwealth and other countries of the West.Its usefulness as a non-discriminatory (on the grounds of color) institution could only continue so long as the political climate in the whole of Central and Southern Africa remained equable. But it did not. With the other two components of the Federation now independent states of Malawi and Zambia served by their own universities which are truly African in outlook, the University College of Rhodesia, as it is now called, is attempting to serve the interests of the present Rhodesian society, with its conflicting needs. The question of whether or not it can execute these needs under the present circumstances I shall deal with shortly. But let me highlight some of the events which took place when I was a student and which will certainly have a bearing on any future developments at the college.After the coming into power of the Rhodesian Government in 1962 and the dissolution of Federation in 1964, there was a concerted effort in the Legislative Assembly by government to discredit the university as a hot-bed of communism.When UDI came in November 1965, a period of crisis began, UNESCO (United Nations Edcational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) immediately withdrew 10 professors and lecturers it had seconded to the college. These were sent to Zambia. The crisis heightened the following year at a graduation ceremony when staff and students demonstrated against cabinet members of the Smith regime, who had been invited to attend.When the demonstration continued during the following week, police moved on the campus arresting several staff and students. There were mass resignations from a number of teaching departments and the college had to be closed for a couple of weeks. After out-cries in the Rhodesian Assembly for further action to be taken, the lecturers and students were deported to Britain.These events might look trivial to an audience in a country that has become used to more violent student demonstrations. But this is not so in Rhodesia. Since 1966 the University College of Rhodesia has been crippled through lack of staff. Senior positions have been filled by lowly qualified people recruited from the Rhodesian or South African market. A number of professorial chairs have gone vacant for years, and general expansion has come to a stand - still.After the first vice - chancellor, Dr. Walter Adams, now director of the London School of Economics, completed his contract at the end of 1966, the college went without a head for a year until the end of 1967, when Professor Terence Miller took over. Now he has resigned because he cannot remain in a country under a racist government which bars black graduates from getting jobs in the government service.The concept of a university, especially as a college of an English university, was a wonderful idea. But so many wonderfully - conceived ideas in this country today are falling bs the way - side.In its 12 years of existence the college has produced only 192 black graduates as compared with 608 white ones. This is because of the government's policy on African education -- a subject I shall leave for a separate column later.The discussions which have been going on recently prove a serious trend by the government to provide a separate and inferior university for blacks. This will bring into line the Rhodesian policy with that of South Africa where educational institutions are segregated on racial grounds. Then blacks cannot claim equality with the whites at university level.Photo (Justin V.J. Nyoka)","1969",0,1

I have absolute confidence in his judgment and integrity.""In offering to defend James Earl Ray, he is trying to move nonviolence into a new dimension of American life. Rev. Bevel is speaking to the real issue -- namely, that is not who killed Dr. King but what killed him. One man should not be made the scapegoat for this monstrous crime. The American public must have all the information about the guilt for this murder. If a conspiracy exists, and I believe it does, it must be fully exposed. Going beyond a conspiracy, Americans must understand the broader guilt of a society which has been killing off its best young leaders -- including John F. Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Robert F, Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.""It would be well for the American people to seek the justice Dr. King worked for, rather than the murder of Mr. Ray. Mr. Bevel, in the best tradition of nonviolence, is looking past the question of killing to the question of life in his offer to defend Mr. Ray's life. I call upon America's oppressed and victimized to come to the aid and defense of the accused man. If all who share the guilt for Dr. King's assassination were put to death, it would be an atrocity greater than that committed by Adolph Hitler.

He accomplished the most difficult tasks and rose to the ultimate public goals in an uncanny manner. As a military giant, he lacked the charisma of such of his contemporaries as General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur, and England's General Montgomery. Nor could he be compared with General of the Armies, George C. Marshall for sheer military brilliance. Yet he was chosen to lead the total allied forces in World War II. He commanded the greatest army ever assembled in history. He was successful in this assignment and the mode of his life.As a neophyte in civilian politics, he captured the Presidency of the United States, serving the nation for eight years. He left that office with the American people applauding the performance of their ""Ike."" He lived a life basically void of criticism, controversy and confrontation. The American public was prepared for his death as they were for his triumphs. As the nation mourned there was no deep emotional disturbance, as had been the case with the death of his contemporaries who shared the central stage during his lifetime.Dwight David Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States and hero general of World War II, served his country well and left a legacy for this great nation to admire and honor.

Shortly after he began to do so his followers began to be persecuted. Confused by this new turn of events he quit the ministry and once again set out for South Africa for a job.On the way he encountered a group of lions intent upon devouring him. He fought off the lion's shouting ""God save me"" and swinging his arms. The lions fled.

He is president of First Opportunity Investment, Inc., of Washington, D.C., and former director of the Bureau of Work Training Programs of the U.S. Manpower Administration.""Time is our enemy,"" says Battle. ""As the years pass and the stake of minority groups in the existing society dwindles, it becomes all the easier to sell a separatist approach--naive and self-defeating as that may be.""Minority entrepreneurship is not part of the black separatist's game--a game that to me is particularly grim because I consider it suicidal. Note I said separatist and not nationalist.""As I read them, the black separatist advocates are saying, 'Get Whitey out of the ghetto--let it be black-owned and black-controlled.' To me, that sounds like a hustle. Who but an exploiter wants a ghetto? This approach erects walls around the ghetto and turns it into a full-blown reservation.""Walling up the ghetto will make it easier for the larger society to ignore. Such a course might have the value of postponing the confrontation but that would be its chief virtue. Thus, I thrust for full economic opportunity, for inclusion of minority entrepreneurs.""Battle defines minority entrepreneurship as development of owner-operators from American subcultures that have been ""systematically excluded"" from control of capital. These would include Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and American Indians as well as blacks.Minority enterprises, he says, need all the advantages available to other entrepreneurs: the widest possible markets extending into suburbia, and access to general venture capital like the public stock issue and government subsidy.""I am convinced that the basic talent is there--the hustler and the con men that abound in the ghetto are living evidence of a type of entrepreneurial talent. Coping with the tremendously complicated problems of life in the ghetto requires a high order of decision-making talent. To misjudge a situation means more than red ink on a profit and loss sheet; it may mean incarceration or death.""","1969",1,1
"101","",1969-06-26,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," THE NEGRO IN THE 1970 CENSUSStudents of Negro history and black and white leaders alike who are concerned with the black man's progress in the republic are looking forward to the 1970 Census in eager anticipation. The story the census tells will undoubtedly have a profound and signigicant impact on race relations in this country.The fear of many of us who anticipate the impending census rests in our concern with whether this census will be fairly taken by those charged with this responsibility, as well as whether the findings will be honestly presented to the public. Those of us laboring daily in the economic marketplace of the Negro movement find that the most frustrating single fact is that the black man of America does not know and has no opportunity to learn many of the significant economic facts about himself. Nor is be aware of the true functioning of the republic's economic life. It goes without saying, too, that his white brother is misinformed about the part the black man has played in the past, is playing in the present, and will play in the future in the economic and political life of this country. As long as I can remember, and that is a long time, the black population of this country has nestled around the figure of 20 million. Yet, sociologists and students of population are aware of the fact that Negroes who live in the central city have a higher birth rate than any other population segment in the world, and because of their access to better medical attention have a lower infant mortality rate than persons living in India or China, where the birth rate is thought to be higher. Many are suggesting that the 1970 census should show the Negro population of America in excess of 30 million. It is already admitted by economists that the Negro's gross national product exceeds $30 billion, an amount in excess of the total economic production of the dominion of Canada. In light of black populations throughout the world, if the Negro population of this country exceeds 30 million, we would have nestled within the confines of the United States a black population greater than that found in any nation in Africa. Nigeria, the most heavily populated country in Africa, has approximately 30 million inhabitants.In conversation with African leaders, it has been prpeatedly observed by them that of all of the world's black people the American black stands at the pinnacle of leadership and training and that, given the opportunity to articulate his concerns and abilities in the world's strongest capitalistic nation, his importance cannot be underestimated.It is important to those who are bothered by the rapid rise of Negro activity in the country that the true picture of the Negro's economic and numerical strength be suppressed. They see him as a sleeping giant, confused and demented by the constant tirade of the white press as they talk about his plight and his misery in America's central cities, which house 90 percent of this great black population. Some are not anxious for the general public to know that while in 1960 only 20,000 black families had incomes over $15,000 perannum, it is estimated that in 1970 the figure will be close to 100,000 -- a tremendous increase. Black families making between $10,000 and $15,000 in 1960 numbered 200,000, whereas in 1970 their number is predicted as 700,000. Coupled with these figures, it is important to know that black high school graduates during the ten years 1960-69 have doubled in number and black college graduates have more than doubled.What concerns students of sociology is a true presentation by the census bureau of what the Negro is all about in America. Rumor has it that those in government charged with the responsibility of taking the census are visibly engaged in changing the content and depth of census statistics for 1970. Many fear that these changes are directed in an effort to minimize the factual exposure of the black man's position, particularly as it relates to statistics which can be important in determining his ultimate economic capacity. In an enlightened society, this attitude cannot be tolerated. The public is invited to address its attention and concern to this possibility. Statistics gleaned from Negro marketing surveys indicate that by 1980, if the trend continues, 25 to 50 percent of the population of our 25 major cities will be composed of black and brown people. This being the fact, it is clear to the true at heart that a factual representation must be presented to the general public of this country. If it is properly presented, the concerns of many black and white people alike will be quieted. It will become evident to all that black and brown people who may well be the residual legatees of many of the major cities of this country now and in the future have to a great extent the economic and political savvy to work within the framework of these cities for the good of the republic, and that they are making and will in future make the kind of contribution to the welfare of these cities that should eliminate the fear and concern often felt by those who operate on improper information. Probably no single statistical compilation is as important to the future of this nation as the 1970 census. Therefore the concern that the census be taken properly and reported accurately deserves our continued vigilance.","1969",0,1

Sherrill, a black official of the University of California in Berkeley, formerly head of the Educational Opportunity Program there, has been apapointed Admissions officer for the campus, effective September In this powerful and strategic office he replaces David Barrows Stewart, who had been unsatisfactory to minority groups and to the Third World Liberation Front, the federated organization which has been struggling for ethnic studies and minority group participation in the University since its formation in January. Sherrill's appointment is the second in the month of July and in the history of a black Admissions Officer in the University of California system. On July 1, James Coleman accepted this office at the Riverside campus.The Afro-American student Union issued no official comment but one member offered what is probably a typical reaction. Larmarr Ferguson, also on the Third World Coordinating Board, considers the appointment an important step forward on the part of minority students and blacks. He said, ""We've been trying to get someone in the admissions office for a long time. Mr. Sherrill, as head of Educational Opportunity, was connected with admissions before, and has experience with Third World Admissions. Stewart, the old admissions officer, was more reluctant to let in Third World students and EOP than got them in. So we are realistic about the possibilities of great policy change, which is slow, but the administration in the Admissions Office will now relate to us better.""Official policy, set by the State Coordinating Council on Higher Education and the State assembly, allows the University of California to admit 96% of its students only with a 3.0 high school grade point average or high college admissions test scores, standards which favor a middle-class white background. The 4% who are exceptions to this rule are, at the University of California in Berkeley, divided among athletes -- who get one-fourth of the quota, or deprived minority students -- about two-thirds, and others admitted for miscellaneous reasons. The Educational Opportunity Program, under Sherrill's direction this year, advised the Admissions Office on its admittance of 1100 students, all but 65 of whom were minority, Third World, students. The EOP also offers counselling service and financial and academic assistance to its proteges.Sherrill, who lives with his wife Mildred and their five children in the northern part of Berkeley, has 16 years of experience in teaching and counseling. After receiving his B. A. in history and sociology at Shaw University in North Carolina, he taught in Virginia high schools for five years, then went to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for his M. A. in counseling psychology. From 1960 to 1967 he counseled at Garfield and Willard Junior high school, then at Berkeley high school for the Berkeley Unified School District. In the 1967-1968 school year, prior to becoming head of the University of California's EOP, he directed the counseling services of that program.A busy man, still directing the nine-man EOP office this summer and preparing to take over the Admissions Office staff of 50 in September, Sherrill offered no comment on his predecessor Stewart. Stewart had been quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle as saying the EOP occasionally gets ""out of hand.""As noted before, the power to change general admission policy is controlled by state offices such as the State coordinating Council on Higher Education. But Sherrill offered some of his own views on the subject during a July 28th interview in his office at Dwinelle Hall.""Ideally,"" he said, ""the basis for admission would be an open door policy where every student who wanted to could come to the University.""In the absence of a complete open door -- ""The high school grade point average, taking into account the student's possible improvement from a poor start would probably be the best indication of his ability."" An interview with the student, if possible, combined with the grade point and his essay on why he wants to be admitted, would be Sherrill's ideal criteria. The standard college entrance tests are unsatisfactory now since they are geared to middle-class white culture. Sherrill, who recently attended a conference on tests at Princeton, believes that these tests should and will be updated. The Educational Testing Service, which produces the widely used Standard Aptitude Test (SAT), admitted at the conference that changes would have to be made in the tests.Sherrill suggested changes in the tests and in foreign language requirements. The tests could be composed of equally weighted segments each favoring a different cultural group, so that each group would be at an equal disadvantage. He said, ""I think they don't have much choice except to become relevant because there is a trend even among the middle-class students to doubt that the tests are accurate predictors of success at the University.""Foreign language requirements too could be changed for fairness to minority group applicants. For instance, for a Sioux Indian English could be considered the foreign language.The biggest change Sherrill would like to see is in the proportion of Third World students at the University of California A whopping 25.6% of California's population is composed of nonwhite or Spanish-speaking people. The University should have that proportion of Third World students. This would require a major about-face for the educational Master Plan of California. That plan now specifies that students will be admitted to California institutions of higher education on the basis of their position in their high school classes. The top 12% (in grade point averages) are eligible for any of the University's nine campuses. The top 30% may go to the state colleges. The junior colleges admit all who have completed high school.The present small quota on minority students is not only a major complaint for Third World people on and off campus. It also causes competition among the various Third World campus organizations, and therefore major difficulties for administrators like Sherrill who are caught between official restrictions and the organizations' demands. Most complaints this year at Berkeley have been made by the Chicanos, claiming a greater share of EOP admissions, in proportion to their population in the state.The terrifically busy Sherrill wants above all to avoid more of this controversy, but it is not likely that he will be able to avoid it entirely. On Monday this week the Chicano student organization issued a statement deploring his appointment. Earlier that day Sherrill had responded to a question about Chicano complaints by quoting the Chicano enrollment increase from 55 to 225 during his administration of EOP.In a hopeful vein, Sherrill regards his appointment as a move by the University to recognize student participation in the University. His appointment, coming in the wake of the Third World Liberation Front militant winter strike, seems to be part of a general though hesitant positive response by the administration to the assertion of Third World Power. Sherrill himself as director of EOP has had contact with Third World students, and he continues to consult with them as individuals and as members of the EOP advisory committee.","1969",1,0
"103","",1969-03-20,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," 1969 Spring for juniors, teens and their youngest sisters is a season of variety in silhouette, detail and fabric. It also points up the importance of the pantsuit and the costume. The idea of multiple pieces is important as coat with matching dress, coatdress or jumper with jacket, pantsuit with vest and sometimes also a skirt.The sillhouette has moved somewhat closer to the body, is more gently shaped. Belts are more frequently seen, while seaming often indicates a waistline. The lines naturally create wider hemlines -- many definitely A-line or width made by panels or inverted pleats. Capes and the loose silhouette are being revived. Pockets are important details, so are lapels, not conspicious but nevertheless giving emphasis and variety. Buttons really play a principal role and appear on double-breasted closings or marching down the front in single breasted or even side button closings. Metal or pearl buttons or combination fabric rimmed in metal call for attention. Leather belts and combinations of metal and leather also contribute interesting detail -- all liked by the fashion conscious.Fabrics too have come into prime fashion interest and variety. They're definitely flatter in texture -- crepes, flannes, yarn dyed flat tweeds and menswear materials. Of course woolens prevail, but plenty of seasonless wool and polyesters, silk and wools, and cottons galore -- plus leathers and vinyls. Plaids and checks are everywhere, unusual in pattern, size and coloring -- lots of red, white and navy or shades of beige and brown with green or yellow.Colors tend to concentrate on white, natural, gray, navy and variations of beige to brown. Red, pink, aqua, clear green, yellow are also in the color picture, bu the palette soft and lovely -- never harsh.Yes, the young look for Spring '69 is definitely new, smart as never before.","1969",0,0
"104","",1969-08-16,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," With colleges gaining interest in enrolling low-income and minority students, a rapidly-growing program --- run entirely by college students is joining in the effort. Through grants from the Carnegie and Ford Foundations and the Office of Economic Opportunity, the FOCUS program is making it possible for close to 100 colleges to admit qualified but economically handicapped students for the coming fall semester.Now into its third summer, FOCUS has an all-student staff of 59 working throughout the South, Midwest and West. The program has grown considerably this year, largely as a result of the success of the 86 students placed in college by FOCUS last year. Of these, 80 are still in school -- and 13 are on the FOCUS staff this year.The program was founded in the summer of 1967 by Bill Strauss, then a Harvard junior, who set up a pilot project in California involving five Upward Bound students from Texas. Last summer, Strauss and eleven other Harvard undergraduates worked with a shoestring budget of $15,000 (with $1.50 per day living allowances) as they worked throughout the South and West. The program's current $130,000 budget appears huge by comparison. According to FOCUS' Central Operations Director, Charles Abernathy, ""a student-run operation like ours can stretch its funds in ways inconceivable to most other programs. Who else but college students can bunk in campsites and live on less than three dollars a day?""The FOCUS staff considers itself typical of the kind of college students who have seen social needs and who have channeled their energies into constructive new ways to meet those needs. In each of the participating college communities this summer, FOCUS plans to engage the help of local students -- with the idea that they too might be involved in the effort to locate and provide opportunities for low-income students.Also brought into the focus effort are families in college communities, who are asked to provide room and board for students during their freshman year in college. This means that FOCUS is often a community-wide as well as a campus-wide endeavor, resulting in the greatest possible local acceptance of incoming FOCUS students -- who are, in most cases, away from home for the first time in their lives.This year, FOCUS hopes that still another part of the program will be helped by local and national businesses. Low-income students, whether FOCUS students or not, are badly hurt this year by the cutbacks in federal scholarship funds. While FOCUS cannot itself afford to give scholarships, the staff works in every community to raise supplemental funds wherever these federal financial aid programs are either exhuasted or nonexistent.Dr. Thomas Billings, Upward Bound's National Director, has commented that ""FOCUS' efforts in seeking private resources are undoubtedly crucial this year. These students simply must not be sacrificed through an inability to finance their college education.""If all goes well this summer, FOCUS may place as many as 300 students in college -- many of these students being from Upward Bound and Talent Search projects. By assembling the resources of students, host families, and the business community, FOCUS hopes to continue supplementing the college preparatory work of these federally-sponsored efforts.","1969",1,0

It doesn't matter really that one can rarely understand her diction. One need only be aware of her voice, pure liquid gold, which this phenomenal artist used with consummate, magical ease. Like her famous counterpart of a previous era, Dame Nellie Melba, she and her husband hail from down-under Australia.Since the Kornfeld Associates are the local impressarios in charge of Sutherland's concert as well as Royal Ballet which appeared to capacity houses all week at the Opera House, it is no wonder that the total of 7,000 music lovers at the Masonic and the Opera House last Saturday left but a small number of devotees to attend the opening of the San Francisco ""Pops"" season. The venerable Arthur Fiedler, of course, was wielding the baton for about his eighteenth season, conducting the San Francisco Symphony and guest soloists, soprano Shlgemi Matsumoto and pianist Roy Bogas. The Civic Auditorium with its thousands of seats needs plenty of publicity for the remaining events of the summer ""pops"" season, and the Post strives to do its civic bit gratis. Therefore, it is rather laughable and pitiful to be informed by the Public Relations of the San Francisco Art Commission that they have only a limited number of photographs of the artists for the three local dailies.

Wilson, OEDCI president, following a reading of the conditions by Percy Moore, executive director, said the acceptance of the conditions ""would seriously impair our rights to control our own programs in accordance with federal guidelines.""Other objections were that the time allowed for fulfillment of the conditions - in some cases only two weeks - was so short as to make compliance impossible, and that in many cases observance of the conditions would mean, Judge Wilson said, ""that we would have to use our present staff and their time would be devoted to fulfilling these special conditions.""Since the acceptance of the grant would constitute a contract, effect of the OEDCI's rejection is to put next move up to the OEO if a contract is to be negotiated.Other action taken by the Council included: 1) a vote to request OEO for an extension from June 1 to July 1 for submission of a youth program to replace the former summer youth program, and 2) adoption of statement opposing the closing of the Parks Job Corps Center on July 1.The statement listed four reasons for opposing the closing of the Center. They were:1. In effect, the closing would terminate current vocational training for youth without immediately supplying a needed substitute. This would certainly be a waste of money to provide partial for the youth and yet not supply the funds for its completion.2. A move of this nature would cause feelings of rejection and frustration and continue the lack of skills to perform in jobs now or in the future.3. The closing of Parks would mean the release of a large number of youth who will be untrained, rejected and present a fertile focus for inner city conflicts.4.

As the written record of revelation, language has to be the medium of communication. This requires that the Bible be in the language which people can read.The Bible originally was chiefly in two languages, the Old Testament in Hebrew, with very brief sections in Aramaic, and the New Testament in Greek. Before the beginning of the Christian era, beginning about 280 B.C., the Hebrew of the Old Testament was translated into Greek, to make it more readable by Jews in countries removed from Palestine.Translations of the New Testament began early in the Christian era, in coptic Latin and other languages. Translating the Scriptures into the language of the people was surely ordained of God, that the people might read and get the meaning, (Neh. 8:8).Lesson ExplainedTHE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT (vv. 1-4).This definite coming of the spirit was the fulfillment of Christ's promise to the disciples to send the Spirit to guide them into truth and to empower their witness. The sound like that of a mighty wind and tongues like as of fire separating and resting on each of their believers, symbolized both force and utterance. It was a symbol of the gift of holy boldness with a fervent zeal constantly to preach the gospel unto all nations.""The Sound"" was the miraculous accompaniments of the out-pouring of the Spirit, and the tongues of fire, the fervour with which the disciples were empowered to proclaim the Gospel. The Holy Spirit made it possible for the gospel message to be declared in various languages. H. EACH IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE (vv. 5-12).Throngs of people were in Jerusalem for Pentecost and Jews from all parts of the Roman world. Their love of Jerusalem and the Temple had attracted them from all lands to take their abode in the Holy City. They were there to keep the feast. Pentecost was one of the three festivals at which every Israelite was expected to appear before the Lord. Parthians, Medes, and Elamites are nations beyond the empire and influence of Rome; ""Mesopotamia"" the chief Jewish centre here was Babylon, which, ever since the captivity of Judah, was famed for its rabbinical schools, and was for that reason regarded as part of the Holy Land, Judaea, to which the Apostles belonged. Cappadocia, Pamphylia, is where Jews were scattered throughout Asia Minor as far as Pontus. According to Philo, there were a million Jews in Egypt. They formed a large part of the population of Alexandria. Cyrene, a Greek city in N. Africa was founded in 631 B.C. A quarter of its great population consisted of Jews, who possesed full rights of citizenship, and strangers from Rome. All of these were in Jerusalem on the day of the coming of the Holy Spirit, speaking in their own language. What the spirit of God cannot do with a man's tongue, just cannot be done.","1969",0,0

These had a variety of unconventional power plants, including turbine, steam, electric and hybrid systems along with experimental piston engines with reduced air pollutant characteristics.Special vehicles in the show ranged from a giant military truck with Delco-Remy electric wheel propulsion and a GMC Truck & Coach Division turbine-powered coach to a golf cart powered by a zinc-air battery.In addition, a new vehicle emissions and safety laboratory was opened for inspection by GM Research Laboratories.The experimental car display included the following:A 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix was modified to use steam as a means of propulsion. Developed by GM Research Laboratories, the car is called the SM SE-101 steam car. All components, such as the condenser, expander, combustion system and steam generator, are housed under its hood. The 4-cylinder, in-line engine is rated at 160 horsepower and uses fuel oil. Features include all power accessories, air conditioning and an automatic transmission.Another car, called the GM SE-124 steam car, was equipped with a steam engine built by Besler Developments, Inc., of Oakland, Cal., under contract to GM Research Laboratories. The steam power plant--a 2-cylinder, double-acting, V-configuration--is installed in a 1969 Chevelle Malibu sedan, and operates on fuel oil All components are located under the hood. The vehicle has power steering, power brakes and a manual transmission. Besler has more than four decades of steam engine experience, having acquired the patents and technology of the Doble Steam Motor Company when that firm ceased operation.The experimental special purpose vehicles designed for operation on a road system of their own also were exhibited. These vehicles--called the 512 series--have basically the same two-passenger body size and configuration. One is gasoline powered, another is electric and the third is a hybrid gasoline-electric. Their design and development were directed by Engineering Staff in collaboration with GM Styling Staff and Delco-Remy Division.Their wheelbase ranges from 50 to 52 inches, height from 52 to 56 inches and length from 66 to a little more than 86 inches.

With the clutch energized, the gasoline and electric motor operate at the same speed. The electrical energy is produced by a 72-volt power battery pack. An additional 12-volt accessory battery powers accessories. the car operates either in all-electric or hybrid mode, and battery recharge is done with a builtin charging unit connected with a standard 115 volt household electrical outlet.In the hybrid model top speed is 35 miles per hour. Its range electric-powered at 30 miles per hour is 5.2 miles.

"116","Aikens, Charles",1969-02-20,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)"," NATURAL LEADEREven in losing, excitement surrounds the California Bears basketball team. Their talented playmaker, Charlie Johnson, according to Bear coach Jim Padgett, is a real leader.""Charlie is able to do so many things well, he's a smart basketball player, said his coach.Johnson was recruited to Cal by Padgett who had heard some nice things about Johnson from some of the players he had coached while at San Jose.In the agony of defeat it's not often that a coach will give such high praise to a player. But Coach Padgett is aware of the fact that he's got a bunch of unusually talented players to contend with.WHERE HAS ALL THE TALENT GONE?During the first part of the season he was delighted to have so many outstanding players participating in workouts. He said, ""It's a pleasure to have a problem with what player to start, especially when both of them have ability. I'll find something to do with them,"" he added.So far this season most of the players have played, but with a lineup of sophomores and senior center Bob Presley, there is still one important thing missing.The missing element is a consecutive winning streak. One night a Cal team beats an Oregon team by 25-30 points, and the next night they lose to another Oregon team by a similar margin.In the games the sophomore lineup is running into teams that have three or four players so experienced that they make an inexperienced player look like he's lost.UNDUE BLAMEAlthough Bob Presley is not having his best season, some blame he doesn't deserve falls on him when things go wrong with the Bears. One can't look at Presley alone. Some of the gaps that are opening up in the middle of the Cal defense are due to a rookie player or two missing an assignment.Although dependable Charlie Johnson is doing all that could be asked of most players, he didn't have an answer for the ups and downs of the Bears.""I think the only thing we have to do right is win,"" Charlie said.""I can't see too many things wrong with the way we're playing,"" said the former Scholastic magazine high school All-American.""I like basketball, I can't explain why,"" said the dejected star after losing to Oregon State. ""It's just something that seems to grow on me.""When I was a freshman in high school in Redwood City, I wasn't big enough to play varsity ball. I was only 5-2 and I weighed 110 pounds.""I worked out on the playground by myself, because the rest of the players were just too big for me to play with.REBOUNDING'S THE NAME OF GAME""Maybe some of the desire that I got in my second year of high school came from knowing that the other players were more advanced and taller than I was. I had grown to 5-8 and 135 pounds by this time and I made the South Peninsula Athletic League all-star team.""What I think I like most about the game of basketball is the speed and the rebounding,"" Charlie said.He said the most important thing in rebounding is how tall a player is.The most important thing for him is positioning since he is usually one of the shorter players in the game.Perhaps positioning is an important thing for the big man too, because the Bears are being blocked off the boards by the more experienced teams and two men often combined to pin in Jackie Ridgle during the Bears' last game.If Jackie is being pinned in by two men, there should be some other player who is free to get off an easy shot.With Ridgle and Johnson rapidly jelling, not too much time should pass before Coach Padgett says, ""See, I told you coaching this team would be a pleasure."" His eyes seem to light up when he sees one of his players making a good play and they're coming more often each game.MULTIPLE TALENTThe Bears have several players who do two or three things especially well. Bob Presley has height and is often a good shooter. Bobby White is a good outside shooter, Ridgle dribbles, shoots and rebounds nicely, Billy Duwe has a good touch on his outside jumpshot. Highjumper Clarence Johnson just can't stop jumping, and he's a shotblocker, but shotblockers need timing and timing comes from playing and a natural instinct. He has a natural instinct in his desire, but he also picked up five fouls so fast the referees seemed to be whistling for a parade.WHISTLES IN HIS EARCoach Padgett not only has a problem finding the right combination, he must find it hard to concentrate with all those whistles blowing in his ears.Toot, toot! Will it ever stop? Will coach Padgett have to continue substituting for fear that his players' will be whistled out of the gymnasium?Whistles can stop the best of players, especially if they don't stop picking up fouls like Presley. Maybe if Bob would get his hands up over his head where most good defenders usually keep them, the screened-out referees wouldn't have to play guessing games on whether he hit someone or not.The Big-8 Conference has some good soul players. Looks like the only thing missing is an occasional pair of good soul referees, blue-eyed or black.Go get 'em ... Charlie!","1969",0,0

Lee, said that no one would lose his job who wants to work. White said that transfers to the airport postal facilities were necessary because of a shortage of workers at the airport.The majority of the workers at the Postal Concentration Center were people hired by the post office in October 1966, following the riot at Hunters Point.Postmaster Lee inaugurated a new program of employment for the heard-core unemployed in the ghettos when a large number of people were hired at the post office and given on-the-job training. They were paid beginning post office wages and sent to a school where they studied to take the civil service examination for permanent jobs.Those who failed the civilservice examination continued working and then were given the opportunity to take the examination a second and a third time or more, until such time that they received a passing grade.The program was hailed in the Bay Area as a step forward in curing the festering unemployment that plagues the area.Most of these people worked in the Postal Concentration Center, which is located at Main Street between Harrison and Folsom Streets. When the workers heard that there would be transfers, some of the female workes who live at Hunters Point said it would be difficult for them to get to work because of a lack of transportation. White said that the Post Office will provide regular bus service from Seventh and Mission Streets to the airport.Some of the workers have been working for the Post Office for more than two years. They have received passing marks of 70, only to see new people take a later examination and receive marks in the 80's.The workers at the Concentration Center would like to be blanketed into the postal service in the same manner that temporaries hired during World War II were blanketed into the regular postal service, without benefit of any examination.There seems to be some conflict between the Civil Service Commission and the post office as to who will be hired. The post office would like to hire all of the people at the Job Concentration Center before hiring persons who took recent tests and have higher marks.Many of those who have two or more years in the service feel that they know their jobs well, and that the chances of their remaining in the postal service as career workers are much greater than those of some of the younger people who took recent tests and passed with higher marks. The workers said that many of those hired recently only take the post office jobs for a short time.The affected workers have held many meetings in which they invited community organizations to participate.Many of the community organizations such as the Presbyterian church have sent letters to Post-master Lee protesting what then appeared to be summary dismissal of the workers.

Extender dishes are created when protein foods, as poultry, fish, cheese, or meat are combined with other less expensive foods. Spaghetti, rice, and cooked breakfast cereals are common filler foods.Fillers add a great deal to what might look like a rather ordinary dish. They ""stretch"" the meat and reduce the cost of the dish, hence the name extender. When the filler is enriched like Post Grape-Nuts Cereal, the nutritional value of the dish is improved. (To be enriched means that three vitamins and one mineral have been added to the cereal.) Finally, a tasty filler can give you a more flavorful finished product to grace your table. All this is true with these Mexican Stuffed Peppers.The right amount of spices or herbs added to extender dishes is also important to their success. There are no hard and fast rules for the kinds and amounts of condiments you use; your family's taste will dictate that.There are hard and fast rules, however, for storing spices and herbs. Keep them tightly covered when not in use; store them in a cool place. This means that a favorite spot, directly over the kitchen stove, should be abandoned.Spices or herbs in a cooked dish need not be the prominent flavor. They merely serve to enhance the flavor of the other foods. That's the case in this extender dish.

Simpson's name became synonymous with college football during his two-year career at the University of Southern California. He became a national celebrity.With his tremendous successes on the football field came myriad requests for O.J.'s time. Could he pose for this picture? Could he be interviewed by this national magazine? Could this columnist have an hour of his time? Could he speak at this high school banquet? Lesser men have crumbled under the deluge of requests. But not O.J. Simpson.One reporter was so impressed with O.J.'s highly cooperative nature that he commented: ""If he doesn't learn to shut off an interviewer when he wants to leave he might spend the rest of his life being interviewed.""But, that's O.J. He's truly a publicity man's dream. Talk to any writer, photographer or radio-TV sportscaster and you'll get the same evaluation: ""a prince of a guy to talk to!""I sometimes think that O.J. gets wound up when he's being interviewed just as he does on the football field. He's always better in the fourth quarter than the first, when he really gets warmed up.For example, at the Heisman Trophy Awards Ceremony in New York earlier this month, O.J. spent the better part of a whole day being interviewed. He must have answered a thousand questions and signed 10,000 autographs.He was just as good at midnight as he'd been at 7 a.m. when he appeared on the ""Today"" television show. His last session after that grueling day of interviews was with four young high school players from New York City.They, too, had played on an undefeated team. I stood behind O.J. as he sat and visited with them. All four mouths were wide open as the Heisman Trophy winner spun his football yarns. The youngsters were awe-struck.Another incident worth mention here came earlier that same morning as O.J. appeared on the Today show with Joe Garagolia. As his portion of the show ended, O.J. was surrounded by technicians, directors, producers, script boys, and others. All sought that now-famous autograph: ""O. Jay Simpson, USC.""One of the executives of NBC told us: ""You know we've had senators, ambassadors, and many high government officials on the show but never have they created the stir that O.J. has created today.""O.J.'s message to the youngsters is classic. His rapport with the press is super. His play on the field is unbelievable. It is as simple as this -- O.J. is a publicity man's dream.Photo (SIMPSON THE MIRACLE WORKER)","1969",0,0

There he should ""work to change white attitudes and patterns of behavior towards blacks which are responsible for the ghetto.""He said that the present reality in the United States is that ""we are already a separate and divided society"" and that the Negro people ""are more and more determined to take control of their lives in the communities the whites bequeathed them.""Father Lucas also said that the Catholic Church must reevaluate its traditional approach to blacks because ""the days of the 'great white father' in the ghetto-clerical or layare past.""","1969",1,0

"138","Rustin, Bayard",1969-06-26,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," We have reached a point in the political development of America that can legitimately be called an emergency. Our country is in trouble, very severe trouble, and those who are most profoundly threatened by this unhappy situation are black Americans.Within recent weeks we have seen a conservative appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. We have seen two integrationist candidates for the school board of Denver, Colorado go down to a resounding defeat. We have seen an obscure police chief from Minneapolis run away with the mayoralty election on a platform of nothing more than. ""Law and Order."" In Los Angeles we have witnessed the defeat of a talented and idealistic Negro candidate for mayor and the victory of an incompetent and unprincipled demagogue. And now in New York City we have seen both the Republican and the Democratic Parties nominate come in the wake of a Republican presidential victory and the racist Wallace movement -- the size of which was unprecedented -- we can understand the gravity of the present situation, and we must recognize the necessity to change the course of our common political destiny.There are many reasons for this reaction that is victimizing all people concerned with social justice, but the fundamental reason lies in the dynamic of fear. There exists today a dangerous relationship between the extreme Left and the extreme Right, and between black rage and white fear. The confrontationist tactics of the one evinces a reactionary response from the other. When the pseudo-revolutionaries of the New Left manhandle professors, occupy buildings, and destroy property, the Right wins new adherents. When sincere but misdirected young black people engage in violence in the name of justice, they are strengthening those very forces which in the past have inflicted violence and injustice upon the Negro community. Such acts of protest may be cathartic, they may appear to be bold and miltiant, but let us be very clear -- their primary effect is politically reactionary.These acts have set loose a wave of panic in this country. And there are opportunistic right-wing demagogues who understand the nature of that panic and are building their political futures upon it. These demagogues don't believe in meeting the urgent needs of the black community for income and education. Indeed, social justice would threaten the very base of fear upon which they stand, for it would remove the cause of social unrest. Their program is the billy club and their staunchest ally the police arm of the state. They believe in repression.The lessons of the past month should be clear. An assault upon our democratic institutions will not reform those institutions but destroy them. Violence will lead to more violence, not to social justice. And the fundamental tragedy is that the absence of justice will provoke more people to engage in violent acts. We must find a way out of this vicious cycle.The needs of the black community for adequate jobs, housing, and education can be met only by developing a political strategy that will attract a majority of Americans to a program for social change. There are whites who are unemployed and white workers whose real income is steadily decreasing as the cost of living rises. Both these groups share with blacks the desire for increased and upgraded employment opportunities. Let us build a movement with them. There are whites living in substandard housing and paying exorbitant rents. Their children attend schools that are over-crowded and under-staffed. They share with blacks the desire for massively funded programs in housing and education. Let us build a movement with them too. And there are those more affluent whites of liberal persuasion who sincerely desire social justice. They too should be our allies.These are positive points around which a political majority can be built. Such a strategy is the only means by which black people will achieve social and economic equality within the context of contemporary American society. This strategy demands the repudiation of racial separatism which can only isolate Negroes. It also demands the rejection of extremism and violence which increase fear and heighten animosities between groups that might otherwise be united.Black people are enraged because there are social injustices which provoke rage. But if that rage is not expressed politically, if it is not devoted towards achieving constructive goals, then it will be self-defeating and ultimately self-destructive. Let us be enraged about injustice, but let us not be destroyed by it. Let us act now with forcefulness but restraint, with militancy but wisdom in the hope of liberating ourselves from rage and injustice, and our white brothers from the fear which now enslaves them.","1969",0,1

"143","Young, Whitney M, Jr",1969-08-14,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," The Administration's plan for preventive detention of persons accused of some crimes is a threat to the civil liberties of all, and can only be seen as a very dangerous threat to minority groups.Briefly, the idea is that before an accused is released on bail, he'd have to go before a judge who would then decide whether he ""probably"" is guilty or might commit another crime while out on bail. The judge can then have the prisoner locked up for at least 2 months without bail.Because crime is such a very real problem, especially to black people living in urban slums, some people might see this proposal as being quite reasonable.It's not. In fact, it's a strange way to dispense justice. Many ideas look good on paper, but when they're carried out they prove totally unfair and unworkable.Black people, especially, have never really had a fair deal from the courts. Study after study has shown that black people charged with the same crimes as whites are convicted more often and get tougher sentences.Many people are afraid that this preventive detention plan would just work out to be a way to lock up black people accused of crimes, and that it even might be the first step of a series of repressive measures that could lead to racial concentration camps.It's easy to say ""it can't happen here,"" but in fact it did. During World War II Japanese-Americans who were accused of nothing more than of being of Japanese ancestry were thrown into concentration camps.Who can say, with any certitude, that if racial tensions reached the boiling point at some time in the future, such camps wouldn't be used again?But whatever the latent dangers of such infringements of liberties, preventive detention places an unfair burden on people accused of crimes and on the judges themselves.How can anyone, especially a judge, whose career and life-style doesn't equip him to understand the problems of the poor and the black, determine who ""might"" commit a crime at some future date?The District of Columbia Crime Commission made a surbey of people who came before the District Court. There were about 2,700 people and a mere 124 were accused of crimes that would qualify them for preventive detention. And let's not forget -- they were accused, not convicted.How could anyone predict who among those 124 would commit another crime? How can a busy judge, already under a staggering backlog of cases, make a fair determination? Do we want judges or fortune tellers in our courts?But proposals that open the door to unfair jailing of innocents, especially, as is likely to happen, unfair jailing of black people, can only lead to disaster.The first casually of any preventive detention law would be the Constitution. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. To jail a man because a harried judge has a hunch that he might go out and commit a crime is to open the doors to an era of repression and the death of civil liberties.The aim of the proposals is to keep hardened criminals off the streets. The best way to achieve that goal is to improve police work and the court system so that more criminals would be caught and brought quickly to trial.Crime is a serious problem. The real preventive measures needed are better job opportunities, an end to poverty and discrimination, and better schools. You can't separate crime from the social environment that creates it.Repressive laws and panicky attacks on civil liberties can only reinforce the despair and the anger that lead people into anti-social activities, like crime.","1969",0,1

Hayakawa, the pliable president of Japanese ancestry who was appointed to head S.F. State for the sole purpose of putting ""niggers"" in their place.It is no secret among blacks and the more literate whites that black students have been less than happy at the quality of education which has been offered to them.It has been a type of education which portrayed blacks in textbooks as being happy, strumming banjos and dancing under a cruel system which made chattel slaves of them.The American Indian is pictured in textbooks as happy victims of white greed in which most of the redmen were exterminated in the process of being civilized by the white predators.In view of the evations and omissions on the part of the whites how wrote the textbooks used in the American school systems, black students, and more recently American Indeans, have been demanding changes in the curricula of the institutions of higher learning and the secondary schools. The young blacks have looked at the textbooks offered to them and have found nothing in these books that tell of the significant contributions their ancestors made toward making millionaires of many whites listed in that financial class.Since whites told their biggest lie to blacks through the process of the emancipation proclamation, blacks have been pictured in the textbooks as a lazy, irresponsible type with a tendency to excessive fornication, which in turn produced generation of more lazy, irresponsible types who quickly inlarged the welfare rolls.Young blacks have looked at their parents and at a white dominated society that recognizes the increment of large sums of money as the sole basis for success. What they learned about the activities of their parents have not been sources of pride. This is one of the reasons why they demanded and in many instances in the state of California saw the establishment of black studies departments.Any semblance of improvement in the lot of black people which they have received from whites has always been alloted under conditions of extreme pressure exerted by blacks and the more literate members of the white community.The black studies concept has been held as a revolutionary move by whites and most institutions have strongly resisted the establishment of such departments on their campuses.One only has to recall the demonstrations at S.F. and Fresno State, Cornell, the University of Illinois, University of Wisconsin, U.C. Berkeley and Santa Barbara to understand how strongly this revolutionary convept has been resisted; and these are only a few instances out of hundreds in the nation.Black students were informed by white administrators that no black studies departments could be established in white schools because there were not enough black scholars in the nation to fill the needed positions.Again one only has to look at the type of education offered to American students in which blacks were almost totally omitted in the textbooks to understand the mentality of white administrators naive enough to say that there were not enough black scholars.The white administrators divorced themselves so long from the existence of black Americans that they have failed to understand that there has been a long list of blacks who have made significant contributions towards chronicling all phases of black life in the United States.These black scholars are as prestigious as their white counterparts because they are black and have been extended the same type of treatment at the hands of whites as all other blacks.Any efforts to disestablish the black studies departments in any school in the nation will be the signal for further, and perhaps, more bloody confrontations by young blacks, who incidentally are becoming more than disillusioned that it is only blacks who are on the receiving end of bullets fired by persons who are determined to keep blacks in the ranks of the illiterates.As long as the United States elects its public officials under the same old system in which the rich are the masters and the office-holders are their servants, black Americans will still be contained in the same old manner.Blacks have been the principal political football of this nation, first during slavery days when politicians assume stands of either for or against slavery, which always assured their election, or in more modern times when politicians were against granting blacks full privileges or citizenship, or denying them the same.There are a growing number of whites who seek social reform, but they have yet to convince skeptical blacks that they wish to see blacks attain the goal of being full-fledged members of human society.The nation is facing its most serious crisis because of its racial policies but seem unwilling to cope with the crisis with a realistic program.","1970",0,1

It flows all over the place and generates additional confusion.From a moral commitment should flow the necessary dollar and judicial resources to eradicate racism and poverty, the basis for much of the caneerous ill that threatens the lives of all Americans and this great American Republic.The hypocracy that has historically overshadowed the good deeds of a few Americans in the battle for a just and relevant America must be bombarded by new and stronger federal resources.The Federal Government must assume a more dynamic and overt leadership role in promoting values and morals that seek to strengthen our nation's institutions, e.g., churches, schools, family life, and political entities, etc.Not until federal leadership sets its judicial foot down and demand equality for all and free itself free hypocracy will it strengthen the moral fiber of its populace, insure hope, pride and a real aense of patriotism.Crime and an alarming increase in homocides are becoming as American as apple pie. Not only is this fact frightening, but if it continues there is little doubt that all Americans will be severely effected. It is a tragedy that we are all destined to be destroyed by, if a new and vigorous approach is not utilized to correct the basic socioeconomic causes in America.We can elect a dozen different Presidents, make all types of speeches, build the biggest and most devastating arms, fight the largest and most expensive wars. march against Communism or other isms, etc, but unless America starts being more ""honest,"" she will fall. How can we establish the obviously needed new values? First, we must recognized that our leaderships' value has to be measured in terms of its ability to eradicate racism and poverty in America, unite all Americans around common goals and values and generate a new and visible sense of morality in America.Hypocracy runs rampart in America. White America has stewed for so long in white racism and has gained economically by exploiting its ethnic minorities until it is exceedingly difficult for leadership to effectively tackle its myriad domestic and international problems.There exist a general feeling among white Americans that one has to be white to contain value and dignity. Unfortunately, too many of America's ethnic minorities have been brain-washed into accepting this misnomer.Our military stand in Korea a few years ago and currently in Southeast Asia are classic examples of the sense of powerfulness that intoxicates us. However, our might and indignity threatens our survival in the world community.We must place less emphasis on military intervention and provide disadvantaged foreign nations with greater technical and material resources. If we cannot promote through goodwill rather than arm power, I think we had better re-examine what we are seeking to sell.We must never forget that Democracy is best promoted at home and abroad in an atmosphere of peace, understanding, and goodwill. Unless we utilize American aid at home and abroad to the extent that it supports this concept and protects the U. S. from foreign and domestic attack, our nation will not survive.","1970",0,1

Delius, teacher-coordinator of Distributive Education at Fremont high school. ""The DE teachers feel that this is the single most important thing we have done in Oakland in five years.""He credited the cooperation of Ed McMillan, personnel manager of Ward's Oakland retail store, for making it possible for more than 200 students to observe a large retail store in action.The students gained practical experience in cash register procedure for cash and charge sales.The course was a condensed training program of that given to new Ward employees.Ward Instructor Linda Krajcar, explained the skills necessary to serve customers and handle money transactions. She guided the students through a day-long self-help program.Each student progressed at his own speed and when ready to solve problems went to one of eight mobile cash registers where individual help was given.Distributive Education is a national organization, which operates under the supervision of the local public school system. Students who enroll in DE courses earn high school or college credits for on-the-job training as well as for classroom instruction.In Oakland each public high school has a DE teacher-coordinator.According to Dellis it is often very difficult to find industries willing to serve as ""training stations"" for students participating in the program.All DE students attend morning classes. Junior and seniors take a semester of salesmanship and follow with a semester of merchandising. Hopefully they find work in related industries during afternoons, evenings and Saturdays.McMillan said, ""Our interest was to give this large number of students an opportunity to learn cash register procedure in an actual situation so that they might learn the practical side of retailing to supplement the classroom learning. Many of these students will obtain enough skills to be ready for entry into retailing during the Christmas holidays.""La Juana Goodwin, Fremont senior student who participated in the Ward training session, commented, ""It was a good experience. It made us feel very important. We ate in the company cafeteria and we saw all the people who work at Wards. We walked around the store and observed how the clerks were curteous to the customers.""Deborah Rolling, another Fremont senior, said, ""I have always wanted to work in a big retail store. This experience has been very interesting to me. I like the attitude of the salespersons toward the people. There is a lot of courtesy here. I have worked at the Music City record store in Berkeley for three years -- after school, evenings and weekends. I know that courtesy is very important in helping customers.""","1970",1,0

There are three types of foundation - creme, liquid and cake. It is important that you know the difference between the three types and which one will best enhance your skin tone.Does the company manufacturing the make-up you are now using have color-coordinated creme, liquid and cake-type make-up so that you can interchange your make-up and still have the correct foundation for your particular skin tone?

Brooke, Massachusetts Republican, was not up for reelection. His term expires in 1972.Breakthroughs in the races for State offices were described by black political strategists as significant. Examples:In Alabama, two black candidates were elected to the State legislature, which has been all-white for nearly a century. The two-Fred D. Gray, a civil-rights lawyer, and Thomas Reed, an official of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, defeated whites.Alabama voters also elected four black sheriffs and a probate judge.In South Carolina, the color barrier in the State legislature was broken when all four black candidate were elected.In this state Wilson C. Riles, State Superintendent of Public Instruction-elect, became the first black man ever to win a major elective office in the State government.In congressional races around the nation, black winners included three elected in districts where Blacks are in the minority. All three are Democrats. They are:Ronald V. Dellums, of Berkeley.George Collins, a Chicago alderman who had the support of Mayor Richard J. Daley's political machine.Parren J. Mitchell, a Baltimore college professor who became the first black ever to be elected to Congres from Maryland.In another Maryland contest, Milton B. Allen was elected State's Attorney in Baltimore.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., failed in his attempt to become Georgia's first black Congressman of modern times. Mrs. Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar Evers, murdered Mississippicivil-rights leader, was the loser in a Los Angeles race for Congress.In New York, State Senator Basil A. Paterson, seeking to become the nation's first black Lieutenant Governor, went down to defeat with the Democratic ticket.A loser before the election was Representative Adam Clayton Powell (Dem.), of New York. Powell was defeated in the June primary by Charles B. Rangel, who, with backing from both major parties, was an easy winner. Rangel is known as a ""moderate"" black.Analyzing the results, Representative Charles C. Diggs, Jr. (Dem.), of Michigan, chairman of the House ""black caucus,"" said that the gains would have a pyramiding effect.The 1970 outcome, Diggs declared, will encourage more Blacks to seek office and work for equality within the system.","1970",1,0

A major goal of the new coordinator is to work closely with teachers so that they can offer health education instruction, with a stress on prevention of illness and disability. She is now preparing a unit of study on the heart, which she will then help teachers to present to their children.A native of Illinois, Mrs. Blue is a graduate of UC Medical Center and a former staff member of the Berkeley Health Department.The new director of the black studies program, replacing Clarence Hampton while on leave, is Richard Navies, who taught at Berkeley High School last year in the subjects of black studies and history. A native of Detroit, Navies has a Master's Degree from Wayne State University. He taught in the Detroit public schools prior to coming to Berkeley as a teacher in 1969.Navies defines the function of the black studies program as that of presenting a more relevant depiction of the nature of society in relation to black people and their contributions. ""The imperative of mitigating the past must be recognized,"" he stated.The concentration in the black studies program has been primarily on the secondary level. Now that a foundation has been created, the program needs to be implemented in the elementary schools as well, Navies reported.The district's contribution in the form of educational expertise to development of the Model Cities program is Richard Allen, formerly supervisor of parent involvement for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in Berkeley and head teacher at the Martin Luther King Project.Allen is a native of Berkeley, a product of Longfellow and Willard schools, a graduate of Pacific Lutheran University and San Francisco State and a former instructor at the Skills Center and the public schools of Marin County and Richmond.As educational planner for Model Cities, he will help to create in the community a model of neighborhood service.

Morrison Community Rehabilitation Center, the Work Training Center of San Francisco and the Illinois Youth Commission.Dent's specializations are mental retardation, rehabilitation, and public health. He will work through the Berkeley District's Department of Special Educational Services, which is directed by Robert Whitenack.A new program created on an interim basis, is that of Career Opportunities, through which avenues will be created for the educational advancement of such para-professionals as instructional aids. Purpose will be to assist in the preparation for new careers.Directing this effort will be Ramona Maples, former vice principal at Lincoln who is now on special assignment with the Berkeley District following two years of doctoral studies at the University of California.A native of New Orleans, Mrs. Maples is a Fellow of the Urban Education Project at the University of California.

Prior to that, she was a teacher at King and Edison parent nurseries and at West Berkeley Children's Center.The ECE department conducts 17 sessions of parent-participation nursery programs and seven day care children's centers involving approximately, 700 children and 400 parents. Major goal is to help each child develop competence and skills and a sense of self-worth, Mrs. Keller said, Major goal for parents is to help them increase their skills and competence as parents and enhance their sense of self-worth.Mrs. Keller reports that an objective is to provide space for anyone in the community who needs it. ""We are in desperate need of expansion,"" she said.Mizuhara will coordinate the new discipline of Asian studies, created by the district in response to community requests for more attention to the history and contributions of Asians. A Task Force has worked through the summer on ways of expanding curriculum to reflect Asian culture and conditions. Spokesmen for the Asian parent community have asked that inservice education for teachers include awareness of stereotyping adversely affecting the attitudes and aspirations of Asian children. A Task Force presentation will be made soon to the school board.Mizuhara has been with the Berkeley District for ten years, first as a teacher at Franklin and then as an upper-grade consultant. He has served as social studies consultant, administrative assistant to the director of elementary education, coordinator of social studies and of the curriculum center.

Also, these three lessons are quite crucial to the understanding of God's revelation in Jesus Christ and of the purpose of Christ for His followers...The new people of God were brought into being by the saving work of Jesus. As the new people of God, the true Israel, they are meant to reflect the true spirit of those who are the children of the kingdom of God and to be fully committed to living a Christlike life...I. CONCERN FOR OTHER PERSONS, (10-14)Two reasons are given why we are not to despise these little ones, i.e. and humble Christian reasons. One reason is, God Himself shows them honour by appointing angels to be their guardians. The other is, He cares so much for them, that He has sent His own Son to redeem them.The parable of the lost sheep is intended to show that it would be in direct opposition to God's desire for human salvation to lead astray one of these little ones, and to cause him to be lost, like a stray sheep.II. Responsibility For Reconciliation (vv. 15-18)In this same text, Jesus went on to deal with another characteristic of the new people of God. They are to be concerned for harmonious relationships with other persons and for unity in the church. In the church, if thy brother treat you wrong, don't go around telling everybody else about his wrong-doings, but rather, go to him and tell him, and that way you will be able to gain your brother, otherwise you will lose him. The Bible teaches us that ""As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them.""In dealing with offenders the Church is to use, (1)admonition, (2) if that be unsuccessful, then excommunication. For social intercourse with the sinner, while unrepentant, is forbidden.III. UNITY IN PRAYER, (vv. 19, 20)There is power in prayer, particularly in prayer marked by harmony on the part of persons united in prayer. Having promised the ratification in heaven of the judicial decisions of the Church, Jesus proceeds to say the same thing about the prayers of Christians.He lays stress on united prayer. The way to obtain a request, is to call in the aid of a Christian brother and to pray with him. Still more, therefore, will the united prayer of the whole church prove effectual. Christ proceeds to give the reason why God will grant such prayers.It is that He, Himself, the great Intercessor, is personally present in every worshipful, Assembly of Christians, and presents their prayers to the Father.","1970",0,0

"165","",1970-05-23,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," Martha X. is 32 and may well be experiencing the most trying time of her life. Two months ago, she divorced her husband of 10 years on the grounds of mental cruelty.The problems Martha now must face are severe and serious dilemmas. Before her lies the perplexing task of social, economical and emotional read-justment to life.Trying, sometimes desperately, to start life over is not easy. Many time, she finds herself caught in a confusing quandary, confronted by scores of new problems.Chief among her worries is her 5-year-old son, Timmy. After a long and costly court battle, she won custody of the boy, but clearly realizes he is at an age where he needs to identify with a strong male figure. She also knows a weekend father once a month is not enough.Well aware that Timmy's sense of emotional security has been threatened, she worries about his reaction to the divorce. Feeling she must compensate for the loss he is experiencing, she gives him increasing amounts of affection, but now fears over-indulgence. Confused and uncertain, she can only try to do what is best for her son.Readjustment to a work routine is another problem. Surprisingly, alimony is awarded to only one-third of all divorced women. If the wife is childless and able-bodied, the court will not ordinarily award alimony unless the husband is wealthy and has been guilty of some grave marital offense such as adultery.Most divorced women are thus compelled to enter the labor market.After 10 years, Martha finds she lacks the confidence in her office skills that she once had. Subquently, she is insecure about returning to the competitive business world.Establishing an active social life is difficult for a divorced person Assimilation into an acceptable social routine presents its own problems.Studies by Kinsey indicate that the divorced male resumes an active social and sexual life a short time after the divorce. One of the main reasons for this, of course, is that the male's role is that of aggressor. After a divorce, he is free to call up and date any one of a number of women or can frequent bars where lonely, unattached women are apt to congregate.It is much more difficult for a woman to do the same thing. Her role is less aggressive than her male counterpart. She may not relish the thought of frequenting bars and would be horrified social tradition to ask a man out. Instead she waits, hoping to preserve her reputation and protect her chances for remarriage.Deep emotional burdens also plague the divorcee. For one reason or another, she decided divorce was the only answer to her marital problems. But still she has serious misgivings and is confused by feelings of guilt and uncertainty. Did she try hard enough to make her marriage work? Did she do all she could to save it? How much was she at fault? Would a second marriage fail the same way? Would she make the same mistakes again?Perhaps predominating over all her other worries are the deep-seated, very likely repressed, but stirring and unsettling pressures society places on her.No one, of course, would deny that divorce is difficult on the husband as well as the wife. His home life disintegrates; he is separated from his children and financially burdened by alimony and child-support payments. But he often escapes the social rebuttal his ex-wife must face.Society has carved as her main function the role of wife and mother. She has clearly failed in at least one of these.While modern woman is admittedly realizing her main duty need not solely revolve around a successful marriage, most of today's women have not escaped the edict which years of tradition have decreed. Sje has, almost inescapably, failed in the eyes of her community, her soceyes of her community, her society, and her sex.Martha X. is typical of a growing number of cases which American women find themselves in each day. A recent profile report of the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau Inc., of Washington, D.C., indicates that last year, for the first time since 1946, divorces in the United States exceeded 500,000.In fact, the bureau reports, ""provisional data indicate that about 1.2 million Americans were divorced in 1968.""Somewhat significant, the experts say, is the fact that these figures do not supply proof that marriage as an institution is disintegrating. More Americans said ""I do"" last year than at any other time in American history, with the single exception of 1946, the year after World War 11 ended.Far from blackballing marriage, the bureau points out, ""The decision to dissolve a specific marriage that has not worked in order to try marriage again hardly constitutes a rejection of the family institution as such.""While the bureau reveals that large numbers of those who are divorced remarry, it is interesting to note the ratio ox men to women who annually attempt to reestablish a marital relationship.Between 1960 and 1966 the remarriage rate for divorced men rose from 168 to 211 (remarriages per thousand divorced men per year), while the remarriage rate for divorced women increased only from 122 to 130--a significant number less.Pessimistic analysts of the statistics, however, point to the number of children annually affected by divorce decrees. In 1967, this number soared to over 700,000--twice as many as existed in 1955. Meanwhile, fewer than half the divorce actions in the mid-50s involved children; by 1967, the ratio had risen to over three-fifths.","1970",1,0

A park spokesman said that during the Christmas season the post office handles nearly one million pieces of mail, including about 100,000 letters from children. Most of the rest were requests for stamped letters to be cancelled with a North Pole postmark and forwarded.The postmarking service is free for any number of letters up to 250. Above that there is a charge of a penny per letter. The spokesman said most of the requests for the postmark, which is a standard Post Office Department stamp with North Pole in the circle, come from persons who want to add a special touch to their holiday greeting cards.The envelopes must be stamped and addressed, with ZIP codes, and mailed in a larger envelope addressed to: Postmaster, Santa's Workshop, North Pole, N.Y., 129-46.If parents request, Santa Claus will send their children a personal letter in a gaily decorated Christmas envelope.The charge is 15 cents each.However, if a child simply mails his wishes to the North Pole and the letter arrives at Santa's Workshop, it is answered as promptly and completely as possible.","1970",0,0

This study portrays and interprets the many facets of the interaction of the two peoples down to the present time. Topics covered include the differences between the Afro-American and Jewish-American historical experiences, Jewish attitudes toward slavery and the slave trade, the extent and nature of black anti-Semitism and Jewish racism, the well-springs of tension and areas of cooperation between Afro-Americans and Jews, black nationalism and the Arab-Israeli conflict, the urban unequal-status encounters between Jews and Afro-Americans, and the recent bitter New York City School dispute over community control.This book will be of interest to specialist and layman alike and is a vitally important contribution toward a deeper understanding of a crucial area of intergroup relations that has lately been much discussed and analyzed.Robert G.

"173","Young, Whitney, Jr",1970-10-31,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," In the last week or so before the elections a small army of young volunteers will take time off from school to try to convince voters to back their ideals.Many colleges have adopted the Princeton Plan to shut down classes for two weeks, making up the time lost after the elections. This gives students the time to devote themselves to the political struggles. Other schools haven't gone as far, but they'll excuse absences in this period, or take other steps to free students.It's easy to be cynical about this kind of student political activity, and many people are. Some don't believe the kids will make a difference; others question their commitment and staying power.But this is a unique attempt to channel the very real frustrations young people feel in our immoral society into changing the system through peaceful means. Ballots, not bombs, bring change, and student activists will have the responsibility of trying to make the system work for them.Young people today look at the world and see their country engaged in military adventures and pitied by other people as a nation chained to racism and injustice in a gilded cage of affluence.They look at their cities and see millions of poor people, white, Black, and Brown, callously exploited and discriminated against.They look at their parents and see people trapped in buying and spending cycles, without the courage to live up to the ideals they mouthed to their kids.They look at the colleges and universities they attend, and see rigid, bureaucratized institutions that conduct research on everything under the sun, but ignore the ghettos festering just outside their own campus.The real question these young people face is how to change this system. And the only way it's ever changed is through political action. By putting their energies into the election campaign, young people can begin to fulfill their potential political clout.Another way is to vote and to encourage others their own age to vote. The young, as those prophets of political theories justifying the status quo love to tell us, don't vote. The under-30 age group cast only 17 percent of the ballots in the 1968 election. Only one out of every three who were eligible to vote did. If the Supreme Court upholds the 18-year-old vote, there will be over 40 million potential voters under 30 in 1972.That's a third of the total eligible, more than enough to swing the election. So those politicians who try to win elections by stirring up hate against young people, their beliefs, their allies, and their culture, better think twice about it.The big test facing the youngsters who go out canvassing votes this time around is whether they've got the savvy and the staying power to keep fighting in the future. They'll go into this election with high hopes, but political reality dictates that in many cases they'll come out on the short end of the vote.The question then becomes where where do we go from here? For some, it will mean a retreat into revolutionary fantasies and dead-end movements, half of whose members are probably FBI agents and police informers.But those who won't blow their cool, who'll grit their teeth and dig in for the long, hard job of winning votes and building coalitions may actually succeed in bringing about a better, more decent nation. Political change isn't a one-shot two-week deal. It's a difficult and exhausting struggle, and for those who enlist in the battle and stay on after the summer soldiers have departed, victory will come.","1970",1,0

"179","Ross, Tom",1970-05-16,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," In 1952 the Fire Department submitted a bond issue to the voters that promised 19 new firehouses. The bonds were approved, but only 14 firehouses were built. It took four years to turn the first shovel of dirt on the De Young Museum addition. In 1964 the Recreation and Park Department presented a bond issue to the voters although there were 16 projects in varying stages of planning and construction that were promised in a 1955 bond issue.These are but a few examples of how bond performance has lagged behind promises to voters. The public deserves an accounting on past bond issues.Historically the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has submitted bond issues covering continuing replacement and modernization every eight years (1948, 1956, 1964). On the basis of this eight-year time-table, the projects included in the 1964 bond program would have been completed by 1972, at which time a new bond program would have been presented to the voters. State law requires the borad to submit a bond issue this year to make schools earthquake-safe or be personally liable in the event of an earthquake catastrophe.According to the official Voters Argument, the 1964 school bond issue promised four entirely new schools-an elementary and senior high school for Diamond Heights; a junior high for Potrero Hill and another for Visitacion Valley. Five schools were to be replaced: Paul Revere Annex, Grattan and Cabrillo. Additions were promised for Bret ditions were promised for Bret Harte and Eldorado elementary schools. City College was to receive a new building and an addition.Five and a half years have elapsed since the bonds were approved. Schools completed include Diamond Heights elementary (July 1967) Burnett (June 1969), E1 Dorado (September 1969), Buena Vista (October 1969), Paul Revere (January 1969), and Bret Harte (April 1970). The $1.3 million laboratory at City College and $1.25 million educational service building have been completed.Potrero Hill junior high is scheduled for completion this December 15 and Visitacion junior high a month later. Construction bids on Cabrillo elementary are now being received Out of thirteen projects, eigh have been completed and two are nearing completion.Where the District appears vulnerable is on the Diamond Heights high school. The original drawings prepared by the architect costed out more than budgeted, a dilemma with which many homeowners can identity. This project was also delayed for ever a year by civil rights groups who protested the school's location. Public scrutiny and official red tape explain the seemingly slow pace of constructionThe district also got caught by inflation. Of $8 million budgeted for modernzation, $6 million was actually spent, $2.2 has been transferred to construction, with $2.2 million left in the account. This however is a far cry from the $6 million charged lost by the district's critics.But how can a district which has difficulty completing 13 schools in eight years hope to complete a capital improvement program involving 63 schools in five years? For one thing they already have engineering surveys and the Corlett report with are chitectural recommendations for the schools. Fifty-one schools are elementary schools which require less time for architectural and working drawings. Finally, funds are allocated in phase one of the program for acrhitectural work covering other phases of the program.By comparison with other city agencies, the school district's bond performance is pretty good.","1970",0,0

Edgar Hoover had used wire-tap information to persuade Dr. Martin Luther King., Jr., to ""tone down his criticism of the FBI,"" Mrs. Coretta King and three members of Dr. King's staff categorically denied that the report had any basis in fact.In their statement, the three staff members -- the Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Reverend Andrew J. Young and the Reverend Walter E. Fauntry -- said that they were all present at the meeting in 1964 between Dr. King and the FBI Director, and that ""at no point did Mr. Hoover lecture Dr. King or even comment on his personal life.""Mrs. King's statement said that ""the love, concern and devotion which Martin expressed toward me and the children are out most precious and treasured memories."" She also said that ""the conversations between my husband and Mr. Hoover, which he related to me, do not correspond at all to the TIME Magazine report.""To chargex that Dr. King relaxed his civil rights campaign, the pastors commented:""These aggressive and forceful campaigns are scarcely evidence that he changed any aspects of his policy or toned down his demands for justice.""This referred, of course, to Dr. King's civil rights activities in Selma in 1964, his active campaigns to obtain key civil rights legislation from Congress in 1965 and the other movements in which he participated right up until the day of his assassination in 1968 in Memphis.Said the statement of the three churchmen:""TIME Magazine discredits itself in seeking to throw mud on a man adored and loved by millions, black and white.""It discredits itself in stooping to sensationalism through fiction and irresponsibility. We suggest that TIME reread its own story on Dr. King's immortal contribution, published when he was named TIME's Man of the Year in 1964.""Their statement concluded with these words:""We further suggest to the TIME editors that before they print-gossip and innuendo, they might check with those present for the facts.""Last week's issue of TIME commented on the 1964 meeting between Dr. King and FBI head Hoover in an article discussing a new book, ""The King God Didn't Save,"" by John Williams, in which it is stated that the FBI started tapping Dr. King's telephone and ""bigging"" his hotel rooms in 1963.TIME said that Williams reported that while no subversion was uncovered, ""information about King's extensive and vigorous sexual activities"" was revealed.The TIME article stated that while most newspapers ignored ""the rumors and leaks,"" their existence ""undermined King's effectiveness just the same.""In presenting its version of the Hoover-King meeting, TIME said that ""Williams has the correct outline of the FBI tape story. What he does not have is precisely what happened at the celebrated meeting between FBI Director Hoover and King in 1964.""Hoover, TIME 'learned, explained to King just what damaging private detail he had on the tapes and lectured him that his morals should be those befitting a Nobel Prize winner. He also suggested that King should tone down his criticism of the FBI. King took the advice. His decline in black esteem followed, a decline scathingly narrated by Williams.""Williams' book says that ""the effect was one of slow political assassination. King was spared it only by the bullet of James Earl Ray.""A spokesman for TIME, in commenting on the statements of Mrs. King and the three churchmen, said that ""a careful reading of TIME's article should make quite clear the magazine's admiration for Dr. King's work. As for the facts in the article, TIME stands by its reporting.""At its 13th annual convention in Atlanta, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) officially condemned the FBI and its director for ""their attacks on Dr. King and their failures to . . . legitimate responsibility such as protecting civil rights, stopping narcotics traffic and other organized crime.""The resolution noted that published reports of the King-Hoover meeting were ""absolutely not true.""In addressing the SCLC convention on August 12, Senator George McGovern (D, South Dakota started his speech with these words:""You do me a great honor in asking me to address this, the 13th annual convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.I have long coveted this opportunity -- not only to salute you, Dr. Abernathy, and SCLC for your brilliant contributions to American life in this century, but also to deliver a message which I think you, as no other organization, need to hear. That is what I want to do tonight, I want to salute you for the accomplishments of your past and I have a message to deliver on your work for the future.""But before I deliver that message, I want to make a preliminary personal observation.""It is providential that those of you who were closest in life to Martin Luther King should be gathered here this week when a venal effort is being made to defame his memory--an effort, I might add, by the very people who most resented his leadership when he was living.""It must stand as one of the most painful paradoxes of history that an apostle of peace and justice should have spent so much of his short life in jail and under the surveillance of federal crime detectors while in those same years criminal mobsters ran rampant across the land.""Every American should wonder what is happening to our nation.""For myself, I cannot understand the motives behind this shoddy effort to becloud the memories of Dr. King. But I think I know its cause -- a deepening insecurity which makes men fear instead of trust, hate instead of love. It is a legal perversion that is more obsessed with social crusaders and campus radicals than with the Mafia underworld. It is a kind of official lawlessness that overrides simple humanity, personal privacy and the sense of dignity which are the marks of a humane society.""Is this the state to which we have fallen?""Is character assassination -- reaching even into the grave -- necessary to protect our public security?""Do we need the eavesdropping of sordid minds to secure one segment of our citizenry against their fear of another?""Have we fallen so far from the spirit of the Bill of Rights?""Do we comprehend the dark and dangerous ways that some of our officials advocate in the name of protecting us?""Let us hope that we are capable of turning away from that course to the path of brotherhood and peace to which Dr. King called us.""I deplore the irrelevant whispers of this week. I deplore those who attack a gallant leader who can no longer reply to his accusers because his once eloquent voice has been stilled all too soon.""But I do not fear for the legacy of Martin Luther King. He stands bright and undiminished in the lives of millions of his people. He will go marching on, and you will march with him into the Promised Land.""","1970",0,1

It took this long to get his checks started because he could not prove when he was born. He was sure he was born in 1902. Although he came to the United States in 1907, he could not find any written records showing the date of his birth. The Social Security Office helped him by writing letters and making phone calls to people he once worked for; to a union of which he was once a member; to the marriage license bureau; to the church where he made his first communion, but to no avail.Finally they struck pay dirt at the U.S. Census Bureau. This is the same census bureau which is now preparing to count noses again this year. This story is still another good argument for all of us to be sure we are counted in the 1970 census. The Social Security Office helped the claimant to write to the U.S. Census Office in Pittsburgh, Kansas. They sent him a letter showing that he was indeed born in 1902. Because his name and age were listed in the 1910 U.S. Census, our claimant was able to collect $4000 in back benefits from Social Security. He will also get a pretty nice check every month; not $4000 a month, but still a good substantial check to help him enjoy his retirement years.Remember, if you are within a year or two of retirement, it is time to start thinking about what you are going to use to prove your age. Two years' back benefits are nice, but it's still a long time to wait for your first check. If you have any questions about Social Security, contact your local office.

In their usual style, they got together on the article below, to rap about songwriting with some professional tips to aspiring young writers.To let too many secrets out of our bag would be a bad move, but we do think that some straight talk about writing may help listeners understand how a song happens, and give some encouragement to the legions of young, unheard songwriters who need it so badly.Many people think that writing songs as a group must be one giant hassle, but we've found that by writing together we give strength to each other, creatively, and the result is stronger than if we had worked alone. All three of us have been writing for a long time, but we never hit that successful groove until we got together. Bettye was writing as a single for Stax, and so was Homer. Raymond had a job and wrote a little on the side with Homer. When we wrote ""Who's Making Love"" together, Success persuaded us to write full-time as a team.When we write, each person has his thing to do. Bettye is the idea lady and writes lyrics. Raymond is the music man, getting the changes and the tune. Homer is the man in the middle, using his many ideas to refine the final song out of all the lyric and music ideas.Our philosophy of writing is to get down to the ""truth."" Creating is at least 50% of writing a song, but the other 50% is refining, getting our ideas and words and notes down to that gut level where they speak to people. The words tell the story and the music puts it into that mood so you can feel it. Sometimes we get to the refining point and find that the two parts aren't working together. We've got the words to one song, and the music to another. That's when we start looking for the right combination: changing, substituting, throwing out, and putting in.Professional songwriting has one ever lasting rule: Write For The People. To make a living writing, you have to produce things that the general public will listen to and buy. We spend a lot of time listening to other writers' work, from West Coast rock to Burt Bacharach. We have to keep up with the patterns of modern music, because they are changing so rapidly, and we must know where the public ear is pointing. Sometimes we do write songs that we know aren't commercial, that wouldn't be bought if they were recorded. They are for relaxation, a change of pace from the pressure of picking each other's brains for a hit. As professionals we write for the public, but since we love what we're doing, we are really writing for ourselves, anyway.Today, a lot of people are writing songs, or want to write songs, but they are unsure of themselves, and don't know how to get their tunes listened to. The important advice that we can give is to write as much as you can. Practice is the only way to improve your technique. Lyric writers must develop their sensitivity to the rhythmic qualitie of words, rhymes, and learn to refine their ideas into the tight framework of a song. Music writers have to know chords inside out. They are the foundation of melody and you must know how they are made and how to best fit them together. A tape recorder is very valuable. Recorded songs don't slip away like remembered songs do, and they give the writer a chance to study his own work. Careful study of your own songs will show you which types are best suited to you, and which ones you can't get into. Listening to a wide variety of already successful composers is essential, for they have many lessons to teach, and may save you from learning the hard way. Ideas also grow better with other ideas than by themselves.With so many new labels and artists appearing these days, it's probably easier than ever for good writers to be heard. New studios are being built all over the country, and they offer a priceless opportunity to the budding writer. By getting in on the ground floor with an organization, he will have more freedom, and a chance to find himself without feeling the pressure to prove himself immediately, or else.When a writer thinks that he and his songs are ready, the best way to get listened to is to write the production department of the record company you are interested in, requesting an audition (enclose a lyric sheet and a tape if you have a good one). Though most companies are on the level, it is also a good idea to write your songs out and have them notarized, to protect yourself. The production people will give you an audition time at their offices. Here at Stax, for example, auditions are conducted one every Saturday every month by Steve Cropper, guitarist for Booker T and the MG's. Producers really don't bite, and they hate to lose good material because they didn't hear it. If your first audition doesn't reveal that you're another We Three yet, just keep on pushing. We did -- and now it's time to get back in our huddle -- reaching out for that next hit.","1970",0,0

The downward force of the blast blew a hole through the second floor closet which housed fuseboxes and electrical connections and the lights on the two floors were knocked out.The operator of the restaurant, Charles Puccinelli, and his brother, Boyd, were in a third floor office about 20 feet from the closet where the bomb went off.Boyd was the bartender the night Miles Beaver was killed by an off-duty police officer who had been drinking at the bar. Provoked by Puccinelli's reference to him as ""boy"" Beaver left the bar in a rage, according to observers. When he returned he allegedly carried a gun into the restaurant with him and pointed it at an off-duty police officer sitting at the bar. Another officer, Patrolman Eugene Larsen of the Tac Squad, shot Beaver through the heart.The Puccinelli brothers received numerous bomb threats following the killing of Beaver, however none of the threats were taken seriously by either of the brothers.Five days after Beaver was killed, a 25 year old black community poverty worker Adam Rogers, was hit by two bullets on a street in Hunters Point.

We have to struggle not to save Spelman as a neo-colonialist, 'Negro' institution, but ratherstruggle for the right to preserve the opportunity to build Spelman into a relevant, black institution, because of the great number of black minds that can be reached if such a change is successfully brought about.""Subsequently, May 5 has been set aside as a national day on which to commenorate this struggle for the survival of black colleges. Students across the, country will use that date to evidence the concern and effort to successfully save those institutions which should be rightfully developed by blacks, not whites.The major part of the conference time was spent invarious workshops and discussion groups in which delegates discussed ideo logy and programs, layed out specific work projects for the future and exchanged information about campus activity and political direction. Special workshops included ""Contemporary Africa,"" ""The Relationship, between School and Community,"" ""The Role of Art in the Blacks Revolution"" and ""The Dynamic of the Black Self-Concept.""Seminar leaders inclued A.B. Spellman and Harambee lead singer Bernice Reagon, Jimmy Garrett, director of the Center for Black Education; Sandra Green and Frank Williams of Malcolm X Liberation University, and James Lee of the Found ation for Community Development in Durham.An opening panel on Black Education included Spelman's Stan ley Wise, Mack Jones, political science instructor at Atlanta University, Tendal Mutuhna, Political scientist and African his torian from Zimbabwe who teaches at A&T, and SOBU coordinator Alvin X.

"205","",1970-10-22,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," In 1960 eighteen-year-old Geoge Jackson, accused of stealing $70 from a California gas station, accepted a deal. ""I agreed to confess and spare the county court costs in return for a light county jail sentence.I confessed, but when the time came for sentencing, they tossed me into the penitentiary for one to life...I've been there ever since.""Early this year, Jackson's name broke through to the country when he and two other inmates, who have come to be known as the Soledad Brothers, were accused of killing a white guard at California's Soledad Prison.A lot has happened to George Jackson in the ten years between his ludicrous ""deal"" and the present charge which, if he is convicted, holds a mandatory death sentence.SOLEDAD BROTHER: THE PRISON LETTERS OF GEORGE JACKSON (Coward-McCann hardcover, $5,95; Bantam Books paperback, $1.50, 25600.) is a personal chronicle of the maturation of a black radical leader in a virtual laboratory of racism. To Angela Davis, Jackson writes:""They've created in me one irate, resentful nigger -- and it's building -- to what climax? The nation's undertakers have grown wealthy on black examples, but I want you to believe in me, Angela. I'm going to make a very poor example, no one will profit from my immolation. When that day comes they'll have to bury ten thousand of their own with full military honors. They'll have earned it.""The letters date from 1964 to this summer, when his younger brother Jonathan was killed in a tragic attempt to help the Soledad Brothers by kidnapping a white judge in San Raphael.They include letters to his parents, beseeching them to abandon the outworn hopes of past generations of blacks, of frightened men and women who ""apparently do not care how well they live, but are only concerned with how long they are able to live."" There are letters to brother Jonathan, about whom he wrote, prophetically:""Jon is a young brother and he is just a little withdrawn, but he is intelligent and loyal...He is at that dangerous age where confusion sets in and sends brothers either to the undertaker or to prison.""","1970",0,1
"206","",1970-12-31,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," When Joseph (Jody) Ramey was brought to the witness stand December 21, the thirteenth day of actual trial, new aspect of the trial was brought into focus.Joseph (Jody the D.J.) Ramey claimed his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent when asked questions whose answers would tend to incriminate him. The court on Dec. 22 issued an order granting Mr., Ramey immunity from prosecution based on testimony he may give in this case. The judge warned Joseph Ramey that if he refused, on the basis of the Fifth Amendment, to answer questions, each refusal to answer a question could be a separate contempt, and each contempt could result in Mr. Ramey's being sentenced to 5 days in the County Jail. Ramey has been called as a witness by the prosecution.In spite of this, Ramey's testimony on the witness stand has not been helpful to the prosecution. But the D.A. doesn't care because the D.A. has a 35-page, typewritten, unsigned statement that he claims Joseph Ramey made to the D.A. in June. Mr. Ramey admits talking to the D.A. at that time, but claims it was under extreme duress. The four defendants were arrested for conspiracy on May 20, and Joseph Ramey was arrested for the same conspiracy on May 29.The police coerced him into taking a lie-detect test, told him he flunked, and threatened to prosecute him for a capital offense. So he talked to the D.A. On the witness stand Ramey said that he lied to the D.A. In addition, he claims the ""statement"" is phony or misleading in all its important parts. Nonetheless, this statement, coerced from this young man by police, unsworn, unsigned, and without confrontation by the defendants has been held admissible by Judge Joseph . . .The coercive tactics of the Sacramento Police in trying to frame the Oak Park Four came to light today through the testimony of Joseph (Jody) Ramey. Ramey's testimony at trial has been consistently unfavorable to the prosecution. So the D.A. has introduced into evidence statements that Ramey allegedly made when interrogated out of court by police and the D.A.Ramey testified that on May 29, he woke up when someone called his name. He saw two detectives and three uniformed policemen in his bedroom carrying at least one shotgun. The shotgun was pointed at Ramey's head. Sgt. Camper, a policeman who sits in the courtroom each day of trial, said, ""You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.""The police let Jody go into the bathroom to brush his teeth, and out of the bathroom window he saw another officer with a shotgun in his backyard. Jody came back into the bedroom and phoned the Oak Park Legal Defense Center. A detective grabbed the phone out of his hand and threatened to break his arm. They handcuffed Ramey and took him to the Sacramento City Police Station.At the police station May 29, the police told Ramey he was under arrest, but they never booked him. Sgt. Camper accused Ramey of being involved in shooting Officer Bennett. The detective said he knew Jody didn't do the shooting, but he must have heard the conspiracy. Camper threatned to have Jody's parole revoked if he didn't cooperate and answer ""correctly."" Lt. B""--3, who also questioned Jody, began ""You know who did it. ""You,"" Lt. Bibica pointed his finger in Jody's face. They questioned Jody for a while and left him alone for a long time. He tried to leave, but the door of the interrogation room was locked. He was later questioned again.Attorney Buchman asked, ""Did you want to talk to police on May 29?"" Ramey replied, ""I didn't want to talk to the police on any occasion. I gave some answers trying to protect myself.""On June 3, Sgts. Camper and Horger again took Jody to the police station. Sgt. Camper again said Jody knew who killed Officer Bennett, and Camper was going to get a conviction. Sgt. Camper, playing the mean guy, left the interrogation room. Sgt. Horger, playing the nice guy, offered Jody a $5,000 reward.The police hinted Ramey might be at the station all night if he didn't sign a waiver. He was at the police station 3 1/2 hours. He was again threatened that his parole would be revoked. He didn't want to talk, but he was isolated in the police station and afraid of being beaten or killed.June 15 or 16, a policeman arrested Jody at a swimming party and said he was charged with robbing a cab. When he arrived at the police station, Jody wasn't booked or questioned about the alleged robbery. He was instead taken directly to a room where Sgt. Camper interrogated him regarding the Oak Park Four case.On June 25, Jody took the Jie detector test. After that Sgt. Horger said, ""You lied,"" and took him back to an interrogation room. Jody was told he was under arrest for conspiracy. Lt. Bibiea said, ""You lied. You know who did it. You were there. I'm gonna get you."" So Jody gave them the answers he got out of the folder and memorized, on June 16, according to Ramey.Immediately after this, Horger and Bibica--both carrying guns--took Ramey to Chief Deputy District Attorney Garcia. They remained while Jody repeated to Garcia the answered he had memorized.The police claim there are no tape recordings of the May 29, June 3, June 16, and June 25 pre-Garcia interrogations. Only the June 25 statement to Garcia was recorded.Trial resumes this morning 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 2, Sacramento Superior Court.","1970",0,1

And the response it evoked from community people eager for this opportunity to move into an upgraded field is causing Dr. Scott to explore other possibilities for paraprofessional careers in the biological sicences.Already, he notes, he has been contacted by manufacturers of laboratory equipment who seek sales agents with technical training in laboratory work. And the paraprofessional possibilities in this field may result in a grant for job development exploration from the California Department of Vocational Education.The course that activated these new career possibilities is basic medical laboratory technology (Biology 15A and B), which will be offered again in Laney's spring semester. The students, who must be at least 18 years of age or high school graduates and residents of the Peralta College District, go to school two mornings or two evenings each week. Their classroom and laboratory training will be followed by a month of hospital work experience.

"212","",1970-12-17,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)"," 1STA HOLIDAY TRADITIONOn the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me roast turkey. And yet, turkey has become a year around dish nearly always available in both fresh and frozen form. ROAST TURKEYTurkeys of any size may be roasted. Correct roasting is slow cooking by dry heat on a rack in an open pan. It requires no water, no basting, no cover and no searing. Always roast turkey done in one continuous cooking period.Low temperatures assure better flavor and appearance, less shrinkage and less loss of juices. A shallow open pan allows the heat to circulate around the bird, roasting it evenly. A rack at least 1/2-inch high raises the bird off the bottom of the pan, keeping it out of the juices. Cook giblets separately as desired for stock.For best results follow these simple steps:1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. (slow)2. Rinse bird with cold water, drain and pat dry. Rub cavities of bird lightly with salt, if desired. Do not salt if stuffed.3. Fill wishbone area (neck) with stuffing, if used. Fasten neck skin to back with skewer. Fill cavity lightly, if stuffing is used. Push drumsticks under band of skin at tail, if present; or tie them to tail.4. Place turkey on rack on shallow roasting pan, breast side up. Brush skin with fat. If a roast meat thermometer is used, insert it so that the bulb is in the center of the inside thigh muscle or the thickest part of the breast meat. Be sure that the bulb does not touch bone.5. Place in preheated oven. If desired, baste of brush occasionally with pan drippings, especially on any dry areas. When turkey is two-thirds done, cut cord or band of skin at tail. Cover with a loose tent of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning.6. Roast until done.2NDA FRYER FULLOn the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me Fried Fritters. These include all manner of food; chicken, meat, fish or seafood and vegetable or fruit fritters such as onion rings and bananas.Use either a frying kettle or skillet or any electric frypan of deep fryer. The kettle should never be more than 1/3 full, but for deep frying the oil should be at least 1-inch deep. The temperature of the oil should be 375 degree F. or heated until a 1-inch cube of bread browns in 30 to 40 seconds.BATTER COATED FRITTERS.1 cup sifted flour1 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1 egg, slightly beaten1/4 cup corn oil1 cup milk prepared fruits, vegetables, meats Flour for dusting Corn oil for fryingSift together flour, baking powder and salt. Mix egg, corn oil and milk. Add to dry ingredients; beat with rotary beater until smooth. Thoroughly dry food to be fried. If using frozen foods, make sure that all frost is removed and the individual pieces dried on paper towels. Have eggplant cut into finger size pieces, green peppers and onions cut into 1/4-inch rings, bananas cut into 1-inch long pieces, cauliflower separated into flowerets. (Cauliflower may be boiled 2 minutes, drained and dried if less crispness is desired.)Dust prepared food with flour; shake off excess flour. Using tongs, dip food into batter, letting excess drip off. Lower into hot (375 degree F.) corn oil; fry until a golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper; salt; serve.3RDTALKING TURKEYOn the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me sandwiches, and cold sliced turkey with cranberry sauce, carcass soup and casseroles all from the large traditional Christmas dinner.TURKEY SALAD2 cups diced cooked turkey1 cup cooked peas1 cup diced celery3/4 cup chopped walnuts2 tablespoons lemon juice1 teaspoon minced onion1/2 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon pepper3/4 cup real mayonnaise Western iceberg lettuceMix together turkey, peas, celery, walnuts, lemon iuice. onion, salt and pepper.

As many of today's hits, implied in those words is a social message to all people for helping each other overcome common human enemies of ignorance, disease, injustice, hunger, and protection from the elements. When these enemies of humanity attack any one of man, it diminishes all of humanity. There are many solutions being proposed to eliminate humanities enemies--all perhaps valid to its promoter as a method--yet many of us are caught in the grasps of the futility of it all because we seek solutions NOW.Or those persons an old adage that ""the proof is in the pudding,"" applies. Our society needs deeds NOW toward solution of social ills. It means that young and old alike must attack ignorance that prevents us from realizing our full human potentials and getting more rewards. It means we must assemble a larger cadre of medical specialists to fight diseases that take our lives--train lawyers to contest injustice--garner resources to eliminate hunger, and develop and share the wherewithal to obtain adequate housing. Individually we have a large job to do--yet the system--has things to do too. Both young and old must help make a self-renewing society happen if such concepts are to have validity.One group of young people are going to try to make it happen the second year in a row--by helping their brothers through--Walking for Development--to raise money to help solve hunger problems in Sacramento and abroad. That group of young people was generally, White-middle-class high school students who last year raised $65,000.00 and sores on their feet--to help their brothers. They have started organizing to do it again this year--and hope to be able to attract a broader representation of Sacramento youth in the Walk. The local money from last years project went to a summer lunch project in Oak Park, Breakfast for Ninos in the Washington area, the Emergency Assistance Program and the Emergency Food Closet, of EARA and a Coop Food Program in the Del Paso area.This is a worthy solution by young people who hope to involve an even larger group of youth in this years walk from all of Sacramento's racial and economic groups.

""And in the learning process, adequate nutrition is essential Droupout rates, discipline problems and low performance can be traced directly to malnutrition.""An empty stomach makes a sham of educational opportunity. What good is a textbook and a teacher if the child doesn't have the energy to learn?

Congress has been similarly disposed.Riles said he is prepared to furnish a task force from his department to work full time with the non-participating schools to help them set up programs or to negotiate contracts with public and private agencies to provide the food.Federal funds pay for 30 cents of a 45-cent lunch served free to needy pupils, with the remaining 15 cents coming from state or local sources.Federal funds for the existing free and reduced-cost lunches in California this fiscal year will approach $17 million.Currently 699 of California's 1,070 school districts and 5,153 of its 6,884 public schools participate in the federal program.Free or reduced-cost lunches are provided daily for 444,906 needy children.Estimates of the total needy children in California run between 500,000 and 800,000.A similar breakfast program feeds 55,719 needy children daily.","1971",1,0

"222","",1971-02-11,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","Says the top English authority on blues, Paul Oliver: ""T-Bone's brilliant guitar playing has helped to lay emphasis on the guitar as a solo expression in blues and established a close bond with the post-war trends in jazz."" BLUES UNLIMITED, the bible of blues magazines has called T-Bone, ""the epitome of professionalism. His timing is impeccable."" And DOWNBEAT reviewer . . . Welding claims, ""Walker is far and away one of the finest guitarits the blues has produced.""There is no doubt that ageless Aaron ""T-Bone"" Walker has been instrumental in molding the music that we have today. And he still is counted among the top singers and guitarists who can be called authentic and influencial.This giant of the blues was born in Texas about 60 years ago, to an exceedingly musical family. His mother and father both played instruments and sang blues, as did most his relatives, his parents friends, his neighbors, just about everyone who ever stopped by the little Walker home in Linden.It was in this early atmosphere that Aaron Walker picked up his music. From anyone and anywhere he could -- and to this day T-Bone is self taught. As a youth, he moved to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Texas, working at odd jobs while he kept at singing. He sang everywhere with his family, sometimes as a street group for pennies. It was also not unusual for Blind Lemon Jefferson to stop off and have a blues session with the Walker family. To say the least, it is practically unknown for anyone today to count the legendary Texas blues artist as a friend. He was also lead-boy for Lemon down Central Avenue as the blind-man sang for hardouts.After school he worked in local medicine shows doing everything: singing, dancing, blackface comedy, as well as mixing up the so-called 'medicine'. His $15 a week looked great during the Texas-twenties and went to help support his family.Well-known singer Ida Cox and her travelling show passed through Dallas about this time and caught the act of little fire-brand Aaron. It wasn't long before he became part of the Cox show -- as all around entertainer and blues singer. It was with this show, as it worked its way through Texas, that he learned the fine art of visual presentation as well as technical proficiency.He made his first recording back in 1929. For the occasion he used the pseudonym ""Oak Cliff T-Bone"", the first part referring to the local area in which he lived. But it was the latter part that stuck. (A little misunderstanding of a pet name his mother had given him.)Walker began working local spots after his return from the Cox show, and during the early thirties joined the boisterious Al Gaines Carnival Show, working and touring with the mother of the blues, Ma Rainey. Later he joined Milt Larkins' dance band as singer of songs and peppy dancer.In 1934 he moved to the West Coast with his new family where he has lived ever since. He was one of the first to amplify his guitar in the mid-30's preceeding the modern electrical sound by decades.T-Bone was band singer with the Les Hite Orchestra in 1939, recording his famous T-Bone Blues. He worked and recorded with the Freddie Slack Orchestra shortly thereafter. He formed his own band during the big war, working the Los Angeles, area while continuing to play coast clubs as a single. He sang with Fletcher Hendersons' Orchestra at the Los Angeles Plantation Club and has also played the Casablance Club in LA and the Blue Mirror in San Francisco.He recorded frequently with many bands and many labels during the 40s and 50s, singing all kinds of songs, but specializing in blues. In 1947 he recorded the most famous piece he ever wrote, ""Stormy Monday,"" a song that has gone beyond the bluesform and become a standard. It is still used by many singers of all types, and is still being recorded.T-Bone was one of the first bluesmen to appear on West Coast TV during the early 50s, well before other such singers were seen on the medium. He received much press notice while at the 5-4 Ballroom in Los Angeles and the Regal Theater in Chicago during the 60s. He went to Europe with the 1962 Blues Festival, working the Manchester Blues Concert in England and the Paris Blues Festival among many other sensational continental concerts.More recently he has worked club dates and one nighters all over the . . ., including McKies in Chicago, Soul City in Buffalo and the Cafe Au GO-GO in New York. In 1965 he returned abroad and toured England working clubs, shows and television dates as a starring single. The next year he joined the ""Jazz at the Philharmonic"" group and again played Europe extensively. Some of the concert films were later shown on English TV.His repeat headline performances at New Yorks' Apollo Theater year after year attent to his continued high popularity and genuine influence on todays music. T-Bone has received rave reviews for many appearances during the years, but none more than for his performances at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival, the Pacific Jazz Festival, Ash Grove and Shelly's Manne Hole in recent years. This is on top of all the numerous college dates and shows that he has also done.In 1968 he was back in England and Europe on an extended tour with the American Folk Blues Festival show with some of Americas best and most famour bluesmen. Another recent highlight was his great solo performances at the Tois Mailletz in Paris.This singing guitarist has continued his recording activities thru the years, and in JAZZ & POP Magazines' 1968 International Critics Poll, his Blues-Way album Funky Town was judged one of the top two blues albums of the year.T-Bone Walker and his guitar have been around a long time, and each year this blues giant grows in stature. His popularity has never been greater than it is today. But most important, he brings to todays blues a solid background of experience while continuing to be fresh and contemporary in both vocal and guitar work.And he is also part of the excellent lineup of outstanding blues artists to be found today on Blues Time with his first album for the label being EVERDAY I HAVE THE BLUES -- BTS 9004.","1971",0,0

HertonRandom House $6.95If nothing else comes of Mr. Herton's book it can be safely said that it gave Black People something (besides white racism) to agree upon. ""Coming Together"" isn't quite where it's at! While I found ""Sex and Racism"" (also by Mr. Herton) inspiring as well as refreshing, ""Coming Together"" was for me a bit inadaquate. As far as new facts were concerned they were few and far between--in fact much of the information presented was incomplete. Often it seemed when Mr. Herton found him self lost for concrete information he resorted to emotionalism or name-calling.The fourth chapter is devoted solely to letters and answers concerning his previously published book, ""Sex and Racism"" seemed to merely occupy space that could have more profitably been utilized. Mr. Herton could have said simply said in a paragraph what he took pages to say: all the people that disagreed with him were homosexuals (in his opinion) or at the very least have homosexual tendacies; and finally thanked everyone who wrote to say they enjoyed his book.So much of what he'd written in ""Sex and Racism"" he seemed to have forgotten and replaced emotionalism--for instance in ""Sex and Racism"" he explained (in reference to desiring a white woman by a Black man but it also applies to the white man, Black woman dilemma) ""one of the necessary components for trancending or 'cleansing' the sin of Blackness from their being is to possess the white woman (or man)"". This is to say that many of the people who take part in interracial sexual activities are doing so in an attempt to negate themselves. Yet he is unable to grasp in ""Coming Together"" that perhaps what the ""Black sexopaths"" and ""Black Hysterics"" (as he describes them) are upset about is that in this day and time when Black people should be busy about the business of ""Coming Together."" Certain Black people (in growing numbers it seems otherwise a book of this nature wouldn't be necessary) are attempting to negate themselves.I found the book to be very one-sided: how Calvin C. Herton sees Black women reacting to certain things from his interpertation of their reaction, assumes what Black women are thinking, I feel, after reading the book and questioning brothers about it, that any sister who wants dig where the majority of Black men's heads are at should read it. I found much to my suprise that even though Black women have expressed in no uncertain they want to stand BESIDE the Black man, not in front pulling or behind pushing, many of our men are still insecure about the role they play in our relationship. Mr. Herton and certain college (Black) men he interviewed seemed to be under the impression that Black women are developing an anti-sex complex, which I don't think is the case at all. They seem to think that Black woman are rejecting their sexual advances when what the women are saying is ""we need love as well as sex"". Black women want the best of both of these wonderful experiences. It's as simple as that. While I didn't find Mr. Hertons observations to be especially true, I did realize about what is actually running through the minds of many Black men today. Therefore, while I didn't find his observations of Black women to be accurate. I did find them interesting; and that's not a total loss. Article copyright Reporter Publishing Co.","1971",0,1

There is open confrontation and conflict. There are many who would blame the directors of our penal institutions for the disturbances in them. Others would blame the entire penal system, and still yet others would blame society as a whole.That, there is need for a change in our correctional system and institution is the one statement about which there is no debate. The question is the type of change.Today Congress is considering the Omnibus Correctional Reform Act of 1971. The purpose of this Act is to change the nature and direction of the nation's correctional systems over the next twenty years. The main intent of this bill is to make rehabilitation a ""realistic goal.""The Omnibus Correctional Reform Act of 1971 will stress and expand rehabilitation services, new training and education programs, and a Federal Corrections Institute.Arrest records, court records and prison records dramatically illustrate that our prison systems are in need of drastic reform, and that a major overhaul is justified. Approximately 100,000 persons are released from penal institutions each year and return to their communities, approximately 75 percent of those released are again confined for committing serious crimes. This is a tremendous indictment against our present rehabilitative services.The Omnibus Correctional Reform Act of 1971 has five phases:First, provides funds to phase out the large penal institutions located a substantial distance from major urban areas and replace them with small, community-based correction institutions designed to utilize the most modern correction theories.Second, the bill provides funds for programs of rehabilitation, job placement, on-the-job counseling and correctional education for criminal offenders, youth offenders and juvenile delinquents.Third, the bill provides special funding for the development of specialized school curricula for the training of educational personnel and for research and demonstration projects. These programs would be geared to the needs of inmates in state and local correctional institutions.Fourth, this bill provides financial assistance to the states for the creation of special probation programs designed to reduce the necessity of committing youthful offenders to state correctional institutions.Fifth, the bill provides for the creation of a Federal Corrections Institution to establish a focal point for the collection and dissemination of information in the corrections arena.This bill is an all-encompassing measure which is intended to be pragmatic as well as philosophical. And the recent prison disturbances demand action and not chatter. The authorization of $800 million to carry out the program for the first year alone indicates the magnitude of the intent of this bill.","1971",0,1

Each of these on Thanksgiving were white.There are qualified officials available in this area working high school and college football games who are certainly willing to work a high school championship.A reporter from one of the city's daily papers asked the man whose responsibility it is to assign the officials prior to the game why no Black officials had been assigned.""Well to tell you the truth I never gave it any thought,"" said Elwood Lang, head of the San Francisco School district's recreation department.The callous statement characterizes the administration's attitude toward a number of problems facing the Black community.With all the talk in the past about ""Black Awareness,"" a school administrator who makes a remark about not giving any thought to Blacks and Black achievement is an anachronism.As further explanation of his attitude toward the selection of the officials, Lang acknowledged that once Burl Toler, a seven-year National Football League Official, worked a championship game in San Francisco.Since Toler has been in the pros seven years, Lang is saying no other Black has been assigned since Toler worked his last game which could have been ten years ago.","1971",0,1

"238","Bone, Red",1971-01-30,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Thursday, Jan. 21, the interns of San Francisco General Hospital went out on strike. At a press conference called that day on the steps of the hospital the reasons behind the strike were revealed. Dr. John C. Goode related that since last year, the interns had been waging a strong battle with hospital officials, particularly hospital administrator. Charles Monedero, to provide decent, adequate health care for the patients of SFGH. Last year's negotiations brought little victory for the interns; their salaries were increased, but their main objective, better health care facilities, was not met. The interns conducted a thorough investigation of hospital policy and practices from which they compiled a list of 110 inadequacies that needed correction before a minimal standard of health care could be reached.The list was then circulated to various hospital officials who were asked to engage in some meaningful discussions about raising the level of patient care at the hospital. After 4 months of talks, the interns were still unable to bring about any meaningful changes in the treatment of patients. The official reply of the hospital could best be expressed by administrator Monedero who said ""The squeaking wheel gets greased,"" implying that the only way the interns would be able to effect a change would be to raise a proportionate amount of noise to their concern.So a small band of some fifty doctors feeling that they might be a tacticly powerful source of pressure called the strike. Why the strike? The doctors reply that they are tired of seeing the clinic undermanned, overcrowded, and unsupplied; conditions which the hospital executives could easily correct. They say that they're tired of having to make patients linger in the hospital for 3 and 4 extra days awaiting test results or official red tape when that bed could be used for a more seriously ill patient, in need of immediate medical attention. The treatment of patients in the emergency room reeks of dehumanization and debasement; you're not human, merely a speimen that can wait for hours on end until it's finally your turn; the doctors complain abut this and the lack of supplies, and the almost deliberate attempt on the part of the makers of hospital policy to ignore the malfunctions of vital equiptment on almost every floor and ward. The interns wish to correct this ""butcher shop warehouse"" before it becomes a clear case of genocide against the Brown and Black community that make up its highest proportion of patients.The strike has already spread to some of the workers in the hospital who are being poorly represented by local 250 and are complaining bitterly about it. Some in fact have already joined in a strike. Their demands were articulated by Bob Clarke, one of the workers, and they reveal the same dissatisfaction with he hospital conditions.During the length of the strike, the Mission People's Health Clinic (el Centro de Salud Para La Gente) announced that they would keep their doors open 24 hours a day in an effort to relieve some of the health care normally supplied by the hospital. The clinic is an entirely free center for the people of the mission. It is staffed by doctors and nurses and has the aid of several specialists.It is operated without any kind of government funds and represents one of the first steps in socialistic medicine by the Chicano community. Organized by Los Siete de la Raza, it is administrated by Corey (a doctor) and will accept any of the Mission patients of SFGH. It is located at 22nd St. and Folsom in the mission and may be enlisting the aid of some of the striking interns for their services.","1971",1,0

Most are continuing to have employees put in 40 hours a week though variations are appearing.* Some government agencies--federal, state and local---are getting interested in the new workweek. Several police departments that have tried the idea give it high praise.* Objections are starting to be heard, however, particularly from labor unions. An official of the Machinists Union, for instance, has come out in favor of a workweek of four 8-hour days--with pay for 40 hours--rather than a four-day week of 10-hour days.* Some management experts caution that not all firms can benefit from switching to a short workweek. ""This is very much an individualized matter,"" says Robert Sibson, president of Sibson & Company, Princeton, N.J., management consultants. ""What is good for one company is not necessarily good for another"".* A few employers are having second thoughts. Here and there, a company that has tried the experiment has given it up and returned to the old schedule.In general, company managers are the leaders in instituting the four-day plan. Mostly, they say, workers are urging it.Only a few such plans have been installed in shops where unions have bargaining rights. Most unions are holding back, on the theory that such moves would make it harder for them to win a 30-hour week with pay for 40 hours. Many employees, however, say they like the idea because they have three-day week ends.","1971",0,0
"241","Tritsch, Pat",1971-02-18,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Consider the traumatic implications of a young Negro girl, who never lived in a ghetto, moving to Atlanta, Ga., for her first teaching position. Or...imagine the wrench of leaving friends and ties of a lifetime to begin life anew in the west - alone. Dr. Ann Cooke Reid has weathered both experiences.Born in Washington, D.C., Ann Cooke was reared in the midwest. The family moved often as her father was an architect with the federal government. As the daughter of middle class, college educated parents, young Ann never knew what it was to live in a segregated neighborhood or to be thought of as different from her friends.It always was understood that Ann would attend college. She was graduated from Oberlin in Ohio, with a degree in English, minoring in Fine Arts.What wasn't so clearly understood by her family was that after graduation, Ann would choose to work rather than starting her graduate studies.""Young people never listen to their parants and I was no different,"" admits Dr. Reid. ""My parents were surprised at my decision to interupt my schooling and disturbed that I chose to live in Atlanta. Atlanta? Well, it was faraway from home and I wanted to be on my own. My father tried to explain what living in the south would be like, but naturally I didn't listen.""When she came home for the holidays, Ann wanted to quit. Despite her father's warnings, Atlanta's racial mores were harsher than she realized. Instead of sympathy, Mr. Cooke rode the train from Chicago back to Atlanta with his daughter. ""You have a commitment,"" he chided her, ""you signed a contract and you can't go back on it now.""""It was a valuable lesson I was fortunate to learn early in life,"" says Dr. Reid. ""As a result, I became thoroughly absorbed in my career and remained in Atlanta on and off for 10 years. I began the summer theatre at Atlanta University, which still exists. I also taught at Spelman College.""I resented the atmosphere, but while working inside the theatre, I could forget the outside. I did practically no shopping in Atlanta, waiting until I was in New York or Chicago. I refused to patronize the theatres, either those which were segregated or those which catered exclusively to Negroes. I bought a car and didn't have to depend on public transportation. I arranged my life so that I could practically ignore white southern attitudes.""She recounted an instance when she boarded a street-car with some of her students, all of whom marched dutifully to the rear. She criticized her students, middle class, college educated people who meekly accepted such conditions. But, she confesses, she did her grumbling from the back of the car. In politics, as in theatre, a sense of timing is essential.Eventually she moved on the Hampton University in Virginia, and then to Howard University in Washington, D.C., as chairman of the drama department. She also had completed her studies at Yale.In New York, Dr. Cooke met Dr. Ira Reid, head of the sociology and anthropoly department at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. Soon Haverford boasted two Dr. Reids on the campus and Dr. Ann Cooke Reid taught at both Haverford and Bryn Mawr.Their marriage produced a daughter, Enid (now Enid Odo). Traveling on grants, the Reids spent a year each in Nigeria and Japan. They brought back many interesting artifacts and objects d'art, but not Enid who preferred to remain in Japan. There she met a young American-Japanese who was studying there. They now are married and living in southern California, where he has begun his teaching career at UCLA.After a lingering illness, Dr. Ira Reid died in 1968, and Dr. Ann Reid decided to accept an offer from the University of California at Santa Cruz. It meant leaving behind the many friends and associations she had acquired through the years of living in the east, but it seemed like an interesting challenge, so she made the move.""I'm an urban person,"" Dr. Reid admits. ""I'm still getting acclimated to California. Sometimes I do get the feeling that all those tall redwoods may come crashing down on me. I like California, I enjoy this campus and it certainly is a new experience for me.""The format at UCSC is based loosely on the English Oxbridge system. Dr. Reid is both senior preceptor for student affairs for Merrill College and acting associate professor of theatre arts. Much of her time is taken up with administrative affairs, but this quarter she is teaching a class, ""Revolution in Theatre,"" and next quarter, she will conduct a practical course in directing. ""My first love is directing,"" she states, ""then theatre history.""In discussing some of the past highlights of her career, Dr. Reid cites what is considered the prototype of our cultural exchange program. She was presenting Henrik Ibsen's ""The Wild Duck"" at Howard, and the play was seen by a representative of the government of Norway. He was so impressed with the production that he secured the cooperation of our government to send the cast to Norway to perform for three months. The experiment was used as a convincing argument when the cultural exchange program was introduced in Congress.Dr. Reid also is particularly fond of her production of Thornton Wilder's ""The Skin of Our Teeth,"" presented in Japan for two weeks at the request of the Japanese who wished to see a typical American play directed by an American. The cast was international, only one American actor, and the play was enthusiastically received. ""The Japanese members of the cast were especially quick to appreciate the work,"" says Dr. Reid, ""they understand all the symbolism.""Although her own professional career was interupted various times while traveling with her husband, Dr. Reid never felt discouraged by being a woman, or black, or choosing such a difficult career as theatre for her life's work.""When accompanying my husband to foreign lands, I wasn't just a housewife, although that's what my passport said. I never simply ran a home, it was more like an ""establishment"" for our friends and my husband's students.""Also, I had no particular black image while I was growing up."" Admittedly, she enjoyed several advantages during her childhood. She agrees that while she became more aware of racial problems in Atlanta, she simply refused to play the game by their rules.The Reids returned to this country the day of the march on Washington, D.C. The changes which had taken place during their two year hiatus were remarkable, exciting, and several new names had come into prominence which were unfamiliar to the Reids. ""The tragedy, of course, is that so much was promised, so little fulfilled, so many left disheartened and discouraged,"" she concludes.Dr. Reid made certain, when she finally decided to get her doctorate, that it would be a bona fide Ph.D. she did graduate work at Yale. Dr. Reid likes many more things than she dislikes, but one legitimate dislike she discussed was the ""black"" or ""token"" Ph.D.The token Ph.D. is awarded by a northern institution to a graduate who comes from the south, by lowering the standards on the excuse that it will be good for his race, or he did the best he could, or he tried harder than any others in his class, etc.The meaning of the award is sullied, the recipient is not only insulted but also placed in a vulnerable position. He is shuffled through his studies and then sent back to the south where he offers no threat to his northern ""peers."" It is a subtle but definite form of racism, according to Dr. Reid, and not the result of liberal, if misguided, thinking of the part of those bestowing the doctorate.Needless to say, Dr. Deid's standards are high. Down through the years, which ever students of hers who have received good grades or awards from her, can justly claim they were honestly won and carry them through life as a true badge of deserved honor.Photo (Dr. Ann Cooke Reid didplays a collector's item book of sketches kept in her office at Merrill College on the UC Santa Cruz campus.)","1971",0,0

He studied political economy at Ohio University where he got both a bachelor's and master's degree, and later did his doctoral work in economics at the University of California at Los Angeles, earning a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Nebraska in July 1969.Dr. Roberts, despite his work for the government agency, was appalled by the uselessness of the government-funded anti-poverty agencies. ""All we did was paper work, and still more paper work and totally engrossed in weaving dreams of eradicating poverty but not touching the real problems with a ten-foot pole,"" he reminisced about his two year stint with the Economic Opportunity Council of San Francisco.He said that the EOC and other anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs which the federal administrations cooked up where more to control the Black masses than to really help them. ""The key was to have important community persons tied up with a handsome paying job, the people who had voice in the community and were respected by masses. Once this was done, the anti-poverty programs became a funnel for political control of Black masses and other indigents,"" Dr. Roberts remarked.Not only government resources are grossly inadequate in combating poverty, but the very government mainstay of assistance to the poor ""is not committed to eradicating poverty"" Dr. Roberts said.The poor will remain poor unless they stop ""sending their money and resources outside the community, for the rich are sending little or nothing into poverty areas. No wonder the vicious cycle of poverty will continue to recycle, ""he notes.""""The basic question,"" Dr. Roberts explained, ""is this"" Can $200 million be organized in a way to help the poor, themselves, as a supplement to whatever else is going on?""With this in mind, Dr. Roberts recommended to the EOC in his Economic Development Briefing that ""community organization be used an advertising tool to get low-income people to participate in business development in terms of ownership, training, and employment, primarily by developing business in the community.""The idea behind this is that ""this organization should act to get Blacks to own businesses so that they can reorder their spending patterns,"" and begin to control their own destiny.Otherwise, he said, the ""recycling of poverty will continue.""

Givens says the man had a gun on him. So he knocked him down; took the gun from his side, unloaded it and attempted to return it when the unidentified man fled.Givens proceeded to the doughnut shop and he intended to phone the police and appraise them of the situation. But before he could do it, he says, two plainclothesmen got out of the car and rushed towards him. They pushed him, assaulted him and later took Givens to the police station across from Van Ness.The two plainelothesmen, according to Givens, did not identify themselves at all. At the police station, he narrates, policemen took him into a backroom and started beating him some more--first in the face, then eye and then all over his body blows rained.Givens identified the two detectives as Billy Morris, Black, and the other as Limeo, a Mexican-American. In the court, he said, they told the judge that they had a proper cause to arrest Givens because he was talking to a woman by the name of Mrs. Spear, who he was told by the detectives ""is a known dope peddler in the community."" And so Givens was being investigated for suspected dope peddling or something.Givens said they didn't show me their police badges, and so I started to defend myself against them.

After extensive consultation with women in the community I have put forward the name of Margot Dashieel as the woman with the broadest spectrum of enthusiastic community support. Born and raised in Berkeley, if appointed, Margot Dashiell would be the first Black woman to serve on the Council. In addition she would be the Council's first social scientist.""Other qualified names also have been put forward including Judy Bouck, a young mother and PTA leader as well as Babette Chamberlain, past president of the Human Relations and Welfare Commission.""Many other qualified women commited to making Berkeley's City government responsive to the needs of women and the community as a whole, can be suggested, she said.To date, Mrs. Hancock said, the seven males on the City Council ""have confined their efforts to bickering over male aspirants and have refused to seriously discuss any of the female candidates.""

It produces the backbone for every movement launched in this country.Consider these figures from the 1971 World Almanac:National Baptist Convention.

Leaders of both political parties, sensitive to the whims of the populace, generally agree that the key to the Black community is though the churches. Undoubtedly, many whites think of the Blackman's power in terms of civil-rights groups, because of the considerable publicity centering on the militant units. But they are wrong. The churches are the silent power.In many ways, the Black Church of America has been a sleeping giant, In civil-rights participation its feet are hardly wet. The reason perhaps, is because the Church is a victim of its own heritage--segregation. Its strength came from segregation, and its leaders hardly shared and desire to shift the foundation. In truth it has produced few great names, few distinguished scholars or theologians. Most of its leaders are mediocre clergymen who have developed skill in politicking, shouting or mass psychology.The church in the Black community is big business. They respect the largest investment the Black man has in property and finances Next to teaching, preaching is the most popular profession and because of flunctuating requirements, most any individual who has been ""called"" can find a bloc or congregation to listen to his message.The historical improvemen in the economic condition of Blacks has set off an extensive church building program but also caused a class policy to infiltrate religion. In almost every city, upper-class Blacks attend churches where the ministers use an intellectual approach in sermons. Other upper-class Blacks switched from the Baptist and Methodist to the Congregational . . . Unitarian churches A small percentage accepted the Catholic faith. But the great mass remained with the Baptists, Methodists and the cults, where the average fare was geared to the superstitious, the ignorant and the deprived.","1971",1,0

Mayor Evers was elected in May, 1969.The first grant, totaling $5,000, covers the town's local share of matching funds for a grant of almost 3,000 to enable Fayette to purchase radio equipment to link the police headquarters with squad cars, the city hall and the fire department. Policemen on foot will also be equipped with walkie-talkies.Until now, the town had no direct means of communication between its policemen and the headquarters or city hall. In addition, the new equipment will permit the town's police to be linked with the Mississippi State Police communications grid.The grant of almost $13,000 consists of federal funds from the Medgar Evers Fund - Police Grants to Fayette Law Enforcement Advisor Agency channeled through the Mississippi counterpart agency, which is coordinating the total modernization program for communities across the state.The second grant of $15,000 enabled the town to employ an experienced New York detective, Richard Woodard, to serve as the town's director of public safety for one year beginning March 8.In that capacity, Detective Woodard, 45, will train Fayette's six-man police force in modern communication, security, community relations and other police functions.Last year, the post was held by a Philadelphia dectective, Alphonso Deal, who returned to his home city in the fall.Detective Woodard was born in Jersey City, raised in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and served in the United States Marine Corps in World War He was graduated from the Baruch School of the City of New York with a degree in business administration.

"248","Evans, E Leroy",1971-03-27,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","March 28Subject: ""FAITHFUL IN ALL THINGS"" Printed Lesson: Matt. 25:14-30.MOTTO: ""Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 1 Cor. 4:2.INTRODUCTION: The parable of the talents has meaning for the present and for the future. The teaching of the parable has all the greater importance when we remember its setting. It was a part of Jesus' discourse on the last things or the end of the age, spoken at the end of His public teaching and just three days before His crucifixion. Jesus sought to impress upon His disciples the fact that each one is accountable for the use of divinely entrusted privileges and responsibilities. Faithfulness in the use of God's gifts prepares us for the Lord's return and insures His commendation and reward. Unfaithfulness will surely bring His rebuke and condemnation, even banishment into utter darkness and separation from the presence and joy of the Lord.Lesson explained: I. DIVINE ENTRUSTMENT, (14-18).Jesus pictures a man going on a journey but, before leaving, calling his servants and giving to them portions of his property. The talent, once measure of weight, came to designate an amount of silver or gold, perhaps a thousand dollars may represent the amout, though in no sense exact. In each case, the amount given was according to the servant's ability. The parable is intended for all Christians, warning even those of the meanest abilities to use to the best advantage the talents with which God has entrusted them, if they would share in the future kingdom of Christ.When Jesus ascended into heaven. An ancient writer beautifully says: ""He calls His going to the Father a journey into a far country out of love to the saints whom He left on earth, after having given them talents. Two of them made good use of theirs, and one dug a hole in the ground and buried his. The talents made in trade are the good which Christians do to themselves and others by the due use of the talents with which God has entrusted them. But the man who hides his talent, is he who neither employs his abilities for his own spiritual advantage, nor for that of others.""II. DIVINE ACCOUNTING, (vv. 19-30).Jesus told how the master returned and called his servants to give an account of their stewardship. The one with the five talents proved that he had been faithful, and had gained other five, and also the one with the two talents had put his to exchange, and gained other two.But the servant who received one talent reported no gain, saying that he hid the talent in the earth, and giving as the reason, fear of the master on the ground that he was hard and unscrupulous. ""Well done."" In this parable the servants having been equally faithful and diligent, received, despite the difference of the talents entrusted to them, an equal reward. The other that received one talent. Very instructive is the fact that it is the recipient of the one talent who proves the defaulter here. It is so little I can do for God, what signifies that little whether it be done or left undone? Henceforward none may excuse his sloth on a plea like this. ""I knew thee that thou art an hard man."" He did not believe in his Lord's forgiving love, and in his gracious acceptance of that work with all its shortcomings, which was done for him out of a true heart, and with a sincere desire to please him. It is a law of the natural as well as of the spiritual world, that the disuse of a faculty finally leads to its complete loss, whereas the due use of it leads to its development and increase.

Dent, one of the president's chief political aides, for a fulldress briefing on the administration's efforts on behalf of minority groups.Dent told them the president will ""go after the minority vote"" in the 1972 campaign, but he did not set any percentage of Black or other votes as a goal.1968 LOWIn the 1968 election, Nixon received as estimated 12 percent of the nonwhite vote as compared with 85 percent for Senator Hubert H.

In 1964, only six percent of nonwhites voted for Republican nominee Barry Goldwater against 94 percent who voted for President Lyndon Johnson.Robert Brown, special assistant to the president, predicted that in 1972 the Republican candidates would sound a different note than they did in 1968 on issues involving economic and political advancement for racial minorities.""We could not be vocal about minority groups and their problems in 1968,"" he said.

Reagan's veto of the poverty agency's $1.6 million federal grant for 1971.Rejecting completely a blistering state report, which called for widespread reforms and attacked OEDCI director Percy Moore, the council Monday night demanded that the Federal Economic Opportunity director, Frank Carlucci, overide Reagan's veto.In so doing the council perhaps slammed the door to Reagan's proposal to provide interim financing for 90 days if the council promised to, as one local official put it, ""clean house.""The defiant stand was taken at the council's first general meeting since the governor cut funds for the agency's 23 poverty programs in Oakland.Thirty seven of the 51 OEDCI members attended the stormy session that drew more than loo spectators to Highland School in East Oakland.The motion to reject the state report, which passed 22-15, was termed by council spokesmen as ""an inspiring vote of confidence for Percy Moore.""The 13-page report, prepared by State OEO evaluator Sal Ispana, formed the basis of Reagan's veto and the thrust of a heated letter from Reagan's executive secretary, Edwin Meese 11, to Regional OEO Director H. Rodger Betts.Several EODCI representatives rallied to Moore's defense at the five-hour session, including attorney Clinton White.""Everybody here has one common enemy, Ronald Reagan,"" White said, referring to the governor's ""diabolical scheme against minorities.""""If Reagan is allowed to get away with the veto,"" he said, ""the poverty council will lose all its funding--some $2.5 million from the Department of Labor for its manpower training programs, funds for its Department of Health, Education and Welfare programs and the Neighborhood Youth Corps.""You are talking about a potential loss of $9 million"" Moore said and warned: ""The loss of $9 million will also increase all the tensions that exist in Oakland. If you lay off 200 staff members and 800 people in training programs, all these people will hit the streets. Oakland has got a serious problem and I'll hit the street with them.""Hitting the street is not of course Governor Reagan's concern or what becomes of the poor in Oakland. According to Meese, Reagan's aide, the action was motivated by the OEDIC ""having severely undermined the effectiveness of taxpayers funded programs for the poor and undercut authority of the board of directors.""Moore said Reagan and his aides accused the anti-poverty organization of ""organizing and politicizing the poor, and evolving Oakland into a base of operation for Blacks and Browns throughout the state--a community where Blacks and Browns flex growing political and social muscles and soon will exercise it in shaping state-wide elections.""Moore believes that the veto was directed at him, because he constitutes a threat to Reagan. ""Reagan would like to speed up my departure. The veto is like a drawn sword -- fire Moore or the sword will fall.""The big issue here is that Reagan does not want Moore as director,"" continued White, ""because Moore has been successful in organizing poor people into strong political force to challenge the administration.""In addition to taking its financial fight to Washington, the council decided to meet with Mayor John Reading in an effort to resolve the open feud between City Hall and the poverty council.Existing funds for current programs and the salaries of the poverty agency's 180 workers are expected to end next month.","1971",0,1

Evans, Jr., Esq., U.A. Carter, public relations expert, and Richard L. Johnson, Esq.-- to honor six Black sportswriters who have done so much to help Black athletes. The six honorees were: Messrs. Brad Pye, Jr., Doc. Young, L. I. Brockenbury, Chester Washington, Herman Hill, and our own sports editor, Sam Skinner, Jr.Held last Thursday evening in the Los Angeles Room of the beautiful Century Plaza Hotel, personages such as Denise Nicholas from the popular televison program Room 222, who presented the plaques to the honorees; Don Marshall, who starred in Land of the Giants, and Johnny Brown of Laugh-In, were there to testify to the great contribution these Black writers have made to the community.Other guests included honorary co-chairmen, Elgin Baylor, The Honorable Willie Brown, Jr., and Sugar Ray Robinson, Jr. Just to mention a few others among the throng -- former Black sportswriter Walter Hoye, now assistant public relations director for the San Diego Chargers, was there with his lovely wife Vy and members of the Charger coaching staff. Gereral partner and general manager of the Oakland Raiders, Al Davis, Tommy Prothro, former head coach at UCLA and now the new coach for the Los Angeles Rams were present. State Sen. Mervin Dymally and Councilman Billy Mills added luster to the crowd of over 250 guests who paid $25 per person to dine and wine the Black sportswriters and to make a public record of the community's debt to them. Last of those mentioned, but not least, Vice President and General Manager of KDIA Radio Station Bill Doubleday was also present.Larry McCormack, disc jockey for local radio station KGFJ, was the master of ceremonies for the evening. He did a superb job and steered the evening with the grace and timing of an experienced captain.Tommie Roberts and the Young Saints provided entertainment. The Young Saints are a lively group of young Black men and women who do a song and dance routine. The only problem being that their director, Mr. Roberts, took advantage of his captive audience to plug, and plug, and plug himself for at least 15 minutes beyond the alloted time. But, as we said earlier, the MC was so adroit that once beyond this impasse, the evening flowed on smoothly.We discovered that these sportswriters' skills are not limited to pen or typewriter in hand. Their responses were anything but dry. For a few minutes there appeared to be more than just one member from the cast of Laugh-In aboard.Johnny just opened the flood-gates of Skinner witticism when he made a disparaging remark about San Francisco. From then on it was like ""one-upmanship,"" with Sam Skinner, Jr., stealing the show. At least half of the guests came by at the end of the evening with offers to promote Skinner's new career as a comedian.Brad Pye, Jr., summed the whole evening up for the writers in his acceptance remarks when he said: ""We have just been trying to do our jobs. . . .We are not bitter because we haven't been afforded the opportunity to reach larger audiences through the columns of the downtown dailies or any of the network stations. . . .""He continued, ""We are grateful for your complimentary remarks and your expressions of appreciation of our efforts in trying to help open all the doors in sports for Blacks and others.""Skinner recalled words uttered by Al Davis years earlier when he was being honored by a group in the Bay Area -- ""I don't feel that you honor people for doing what they're supposed to do. We have just been doing our jobs."" He cited a job that Black writers ought to embark upon now -- the job of getting the Black baseball players, recently admitted to the Hall of Fame, admitted in the same manner as all other baseball stars and not through some backdoor, special category technique. He stated that ""Baseball had been the one to discriminate. . . . It is no fault of great men such as Satchel Paige that they did not play in the same leagues as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb.""Skinner introduced Hoye, PR assistant with the Chargers, and said that he should also have been among those being honored. Hoye, Pye and Skinner were the first Black sportswriters to really get on the firing line and go about changing the situation for Black athletes. They were known as the ""three musketeers"" for many years -- three Blacks among a sea of white faces, white ideas and prejudices.Councilman Bill Mills was present to present a resolution from the City of Los Angeles congratulating the Black sports-writers and proclaiming Thursday, Feb. 11, 1971, as ""Black Sportswriters Day."" As he came to the podium to make the presentation the slight problem of the missing resolution arose. So the councilman stated that if he could ever find it he would be happy to present same.The Honorable Willie Brown, the powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, presented the resolution from the State of California, as endorsed by all Black legislators. He stated that the presentation of this resolution represented the highest honor that the membership of the California Legislature can bestow upon ordinary citizens.The Sun Reporter Publisher, Dr. Carlton Goodlet, and staff joined in the observance via Western Union. They saluted the Black sportswriters and stated: ""Please convey our congratulations to the six honorees tonight. Public acclaim of work of Black sports scribes long overdue. By honoring you we in a measure honor ourselves. Thanks for forcing the majority press to tell it like it is. Just keep on keeping on.""Each of the six honorees was presented beautifully mounted personal letters of congratulations and commendation by the banquet chairman.They carried this message:""This plaque is presented to you in behalf of our community as a token of our appreciation for your outstanding contributions as a sportswriter.""Through your efforts and those of others, via your type-writers and through the airways, you men have helped and still are plugging away for progress for Blacks in every phase of sports.""We are proud to be a part of this salute to you on your day.""Skinner said he was very moved by the tribute and that in moments of downheartedness to think back on this occasion would be a bolster for them to keep on doing their jobs.The food at affairs of this nature does not usually deserve a comment as it is almost always cold and/or otherwise unappetizing. It's worth a comment in this instance. Prime Rib, over baked potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce was served individually from steaming hot tureens with immediate choice of cut of meat.The after-party in the Century Plaza Penthouse was attended by many of the guests along with the honorees and their wives.

Newton expressed dissatisfaction with the involvement in the affair of The Ad-Hoc Committee for the Preservation of Black Business.The Committee, chaired by East Bay realtor Al McKee and composed of local businessmen, was formed to support Boyette.In a meeting Saturday night, the Committee decided to cross picket lines Sunday to help crush the boycott. When they arrived early Sunday, however, the lines had already been removed by the Panthers.The next development occured when Newton entered Bill's Liquor Store #2 at 5:00 p.m. Tuesday with the intention of purchasing $40 worth of liquor.According to McKee, Newton became incensed when he found pamphlets in the store stating that Cal-Pac Liquor Stores, an organization of which Bill's Liquors is part, had refused a ""very suspicious"" demand from the Panther Party that they make contributions to the Party, and affirming that Cal-Pac would make only voluntary contributions as they saw fit. The pamphlets urged that the community support Boyett in his effort to break the boycott.The pamphlets were printed by the Ad-Hoc Committee and distributed throughout the area surrounding Bill's Liquor Store #2 Sun. morning.By 6:00 p.m. Tues., Newton was confronting Boyett in the presense of the Ad-Hoc Committee.

I thought we were going to just drop it 'in the interests of the community.""Boyett: ""No, I can't settle with you; only the Committee can.""Newton: ""Well I won't do that and I am going to put you out of business.""The Ad-Hoc Committee is planning to rally community support to break the boycott.In a more recent statement to the Sun Reporter, Newton has claimed that Boyett was intimidated by McKee and ""forced to back down from the arrangement he had made with the Black Panther Party.""","1971",0,1

However, a bank now organizing in Oakland hopes to change this statistic, first by being community-owned, and second by serving the growing minority community of the Bay Area and promoting minority - owned businesses through loans.The Bank is First Enterprise Bank (In Organization), a state bank, located at 1632 Franklin Street in downtown Oakland. The two chief officers are Lloyd A. Edwards (Chairman of the Board, a black, and Robert W. Steiner, Jr. (President), a white, who together with an ethnically mixed Board of Directors are planning to open the bank's doors with full services for the public this month. Also striving with this experienced group of eight business and professional men are volunteers of all backgrounds, working to assure success to the venture.The bank, which promises to be sensitive to the needs of the community, will be 95% community - owned. Shares are available at $20.00 each. Steiner comments, ""With the ethnic make - up of Oakland such a diverse one, it's time that a bank is sensitive to the needs of ALL members of the community, and it's community bank that can best understand and meet those needs."" First Enterprise will be the twenty-seventh such bank in the nation, and the only one in Northern California.Morality and competitive returns are, the Directors feel, not incompatible. First Enterprise is assured of being a viable, profitable business when it opens because it already has deposit commitments from national concerns, government agencies, and large Oakland - based firms - as well, of course, as from many individuals. Despite of its social overtones, therefore, the bank will be profit-oriented; for only by making a profit can it serve the community well.There are already over 600 local shareholders. The first block of stock ($250,000) sold out in only 20 working days. There is still stock available, as the total capitilization of $1,250,000 must be raised before the bank can open.""It's seldom that an individual gets an opportunity to own part of a bank,"" Steiner continued. And the chance is running out. If you'd like to know more about owning part of an ""enterprise"" which is working to meet the needs of all the community, call 839-6300.First Enterprise's organizational offices are open from 9 to 5, at the Franklin Street location. The bank is sure to contribute to the success of community - ownership, and a new image for banking.","1971",1,0

"256","",1971-01-09,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The Portuguese invasions of Guinea-Conakry over the last several weeks were a desperate effort by Portugal to hold on to its colonial empire in Africa. The invasion was Portugal's version of Cambodia - the objective being to eliminate a friendly sanctuary and supply base for Guinea Bissau.The colony of Guinea-Bissau is a small Portuguese-ruled enclave on the coast of West Africa, situated between the African-ruled states of Guinea-Conakry and Senegal. Its people took up armed struggle against Portuguese colonial rule in 1962 under the banner of the PAIGC (the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and the Cape Verde Islands). Led by Amilcar Cabral, one of the most impressive revolutionary figures on the world scene today, the PAIGC has already liberated nearly 80% of the colony's territory.Despite these impressive gains, Portugal still controls the coastal area of the country. This circumstance has forced the liberation movement to get supplies and maintain international contacts through neighboring Guinea-Conakry and Senegal.Portugal's invasions of Guinea-Conakry were only the latest in a series of maneuvers designed to cut off and isolate the PAIGC's support and assistance from fellow Africans. Last year, Portugal conducted terror campaigns against Senegalese villages in the areas bordering Guinea-Bissau. The Portuguese bombed these villages and dropped leaflets warning of further attacks if the Senegalese people continued to aid the guerrillas in Guinea-Bissau.These campaigns in Senegal unfortunately produced the intended results. The smug Senegalese leadership, headed by conservative Leopold Senghor, no longer permits the PAIGC to train or seek sanctuary on Senegalese soil. Senghor has even stopped the flow of supplies through his country to rebel forces in Guinea-Bissau.Unlike Senegal, Guinea-Conakry has not been intimidated by Portuguese terror and harassment. Led by President Sekou Toure, it has openly supported the anti-Portuguese struggle to the North. In the early stages of the liberation struggle, Guinea-Conakry allowed the PAIGC to maintain schools, hospitals, training facilities and other support institutions on its soil. Guinea-Conakry continues to offer whatever support is necessary. The PAIGC keeps its headquarters in Conakry, the capital city. Most important, Guinea-Conakry remains the only route by which supplies from the outside world can get through to liberation forces within Guinea-Bissau.President Sekou Toure's summer villa was burned to the gound and the presidential compound in Conakry was attacked (without success). An army camp was seized long enough to release prisoners, who included both political opponents of Toure and Portuguese soldiers captured by the PAIGC in Guinea-Bissau. Also, both the PAIGC headquarters and the home of its leader, Cabral, were totally destroyed. Fragmentary reports suggest that some 38-50 invaders were killed and another 100 taken prisoner. About 400 Guineans were killed, including random terrorist attacks on women and children. The invaders apparently sought to assassinate President Toure in the hope that a new regime would join with the Senegalese government in cutting off support for the people's struggle in Guinea-Bissau.Map (THE WEST AFRICAN COAST)","1971",0,1
"257","Evans, E Leroy",1971-04-24,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","SUBJECT: GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON ISRAEL. Printed lesson: Amos 1:1; 2:4-7; 8:4-7MOTTO: ""Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of host will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph"" - Amos 5:15Introduction; Amosis often called the prophet of righteousness, or the prophet of justice. He also may be called the prophet of judgment. To understand this, one must keep in mind the state of the northern kingdom.Amos prophecied around 750 B.C. Jereboam II was king. He had extended the borders of the nation north and east. It was a time of unusual prosperity. Major trade routes passed through Israel, and wealthy traders took maximum advantage of their opportunity.Luxurious living prevailed. But injustice, indulgence, immorality, hypocrisy and idolatry were eating at the vitals of the nation's life. Into this religiously and morally bankrupt national scene Amos came with the Word of the Lord.Lesson Explained, I. FROM SHEPHERD TO PROPHET, (1:1).Amos was not self-appointed. He was a herdsman from Tekoa about five miles South of Bethlehem, on a hill 2,788 feet high, at the border of the wilderness of Tekoa. He was not the son of a prophet, neither a member of a prophetic guild. The only credentials he had was the fact the God had laid His hands on him and said, ""Go, prophesy unto my people Israel."" And this was enough, if God sends a man out, all devils out of hell cannot stop him.Palestine has always been subject to earthquakes, and this call came to him two years before the eqrthquake. God always has His way of letting us know what He would have us do.II. REBELLION AND IDOLATRY, (2:4-6).The reference to three or four transgressions was simply an indefinite number suggesting many transgressions but including them all. Judah had betrayed its stewardship of privilege and now must face severe but righteous judgment. The threatening character of this v. gives notice beforehand of the tone of the whole prophecy. The people of Judah had rejected the law of the Lord. The surrounding nations are charged with violations of the law written in the heart, Judah with offences against a law set forth in positive commandments. Theirlies, the unreal, imaginary deities, the Baalim and Ashtaroth, who have no existence save in the mind of the worshippers. The unrighteous judges condemn the innocent for the sake of a bribe. ""A pair of shoes they sold the poor, and the righteous foe silver.""III. GREED AND INJUSTICE, (8:4-7).Here, the massage of Amos was directed chiefly to Israel. Greed resulting in oppression and injustice seemed to dominate much of the nation's life. They swallowed up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail, i.e. to exterminate those who are in lowly circumstances. They made a solitude and called it peace. The new moon was originally a more important festival than the Sabbath. The ephah, the measure by which they sold, was fraudulently small; the weight by which they tested the money paid them was as dishonestly great. Every kind of deceit through short measures and double weights was used to defraud the poor, even to buy the poor for silver and sell refuse or rotten wheat for gain. Through Amos the word God came to a wicked nation. He declared the oath of the Lord, ""Surely I will never forget any of their works.""","1971",0,0

"259","WADE, DANIEL COHODA",1971-04-01,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","Daniel Cohoda Wade is a 47 year old journalist. He worked for the Associated Negro Press between 1959 and 1961. In 1968 he went to work for the BAKERSFIELD OBSERVER where he became known for his slashing editorials attacking social injustice and especially police brutality, In 1969 Wade was arrested for armed robbery in Los Angeles while enroute to a NAACP conference. He has steadfastly maintained his innocence of the charge. He attributes his conviction to the fact that on two separate occasions he served as his own attorney in the robbery trials. The following article is the final segment of a three-part series published February 18th and 25th. The series had been suspended after the second segment pending the arrival of the final part. This is probably the most profound commentary on prisons to come out of a California State Prison in many years. Currently Wade is serving a five-to-life sentence in Folsom State Prison. Wade's attornies expect to begin his appeal in Los Angeles in the ""forseeable future.""Why does the department of Corrections need to produce vegetables? Why did the Slave owners of American History need to breed slaves? To maintain the economic security it provides.The facts speak for themselves. Not only is the inmate a product to keep the wheels of the system grinding, but the majority of the inmates who enter prison are without funds to an extent, and in most cases, without freeworld assistance. To exist, therefore, they must become wage-earning members of the prison society. Were this is the total extent of their involvement, a solid basis for the man's subsequent reentry into society would be established.Here again the system rears its ugly, head. The paying jobs are usually hard to obtain (and keep) and there is generally a period in which a man must work in the 7-day-a-week, non-paying jobs (kitchen, hosptial, trash crew, etc.) before he can get into a paying position. Failing this, he is forced to turn to other outlets for his subsistence -- for example, gambling, or dealing in food, clothing, drugs, brewor, in some instances, his body. Thus prisons become a miniature community with the same economic expediencies involved that exist in the free world. Backing, however, the security that exists there. In prison a man lives in a constant state of uncertainty. For little -- or, in some instances, no -- reason he can be taken off a paying job and thrown into the ""hole"" and stripped of all he may have gained from months or years of work and good conduct. Even sometimes from a personal dislike of an officer he can be ""Beefed"" (give a disciplinary write up) for no other reason than the fact that he has gained the ire of this officer, (or an inmate with juice).From this there is generally no recourse. Whatever the officer writes in his ""beef"" report is true, and unless the inmate has ""Juice"" in high quarters, it stands. This kind of action creates a special type of man who learns to connive and scheme his way through a prison term. Who has no time to think about any creative reshaping of his life while in prison. He is too busy surviving. This man is released with a chip on his shoulder and a life-style that can only exist in prison.The system makes no preparation for a man to stay out of prison, yet it is well equipped to make certain he gets back in.What is the solution to the problem. THERE IS NONE!! Not as long as the system is geared to using men in prison. This way it can only exist by making certain that there are enough men in prison to support the system. Therefore the system must be destroyed.Not by riots. Not by burning down the prisons. Not by killing the guards. This method only perpetuates the system for those who are pressured into rioting, burning and killing are creating the need for more prisons and more guards and making certain they will be in prison to support the very system that they are trying to destroy, and by giving the system more things they can ask the public to ""View with alarm."" In the end, the riots will be quelled, more prisons will be built and more guards hired.It is the public who must destroy the system...They must take an active interest in what is going on in the prisons. They must gear themselves to receive the man from prison and when he is released he must be taken back into society and given a chance to become a working part of that society. The monies spent for so-called rehabilitation in prisons must be used to rehabilitate the man into society. In fact, society must make it hard to get into prison by offering the potential inmate a chance to make it before he commits the act that will send him to prison.There will always be those who so resent the social mores that they must be separated from society, but society itself can keep this type of individual to a minimum. The man who steals because he or his family is hungry or because he cannot work to maintain his dignity as a man will not have to steal or rob if he is given a true opportunity to reach the goal his manhood tells him he is capable of attaining.","1971",0,1

Newscasters warn Americans of the ominus signs that Blacks all over the country are seeing themselves as political prisoners. An N.B.C. Telecaster states, ""They see themselves as political prisoners, they are not.""The people who need to examine these warnings are the Blacks themselves.After years of slavery, deprevation, untold suffering and beastiality by White police officers, incarceration into prisons all over the country by unjust sentencing by white jurors, judges and indeed the entire judicial system of our country, the White press emphatically broadcasts and warns Blacks - your sons, husbands, daughters are criminals. They have been tried and sentenced by our unfair, unjust laws and are, to quote a San Quentin Guard, as reported in one of our daily White newspapers, 'The scum of the earth'.This writer does not forget for a moment the thousands of poor Whites and Mexican Americans who share the same fate of beastiality in prisons.The Black Community must insist on examination and news by the Black press for the good of the country.Blacks, especially the middle class and over thirty age group must face the necessity of combating fear and refuse to be mentally manipulated by the White newscasters and press.Blacks are told by the White press that the reason the prisons are filled with predominantly Blacks is that they have committed these crimes against their own kind. Who arrested them? Who sentenced them? Who gathered the statistics on Black criminals?The NAACP investigations, the follow-up report of the racial situation in the country by the group of investigators of the Kerner Report, 1968, reports nothing changed. The continuing hostility of the Black Community toward the White policeman. All these facts should be examined by the Black Middle class.Attica, San Quentin, Folsom, armed service prisons where Blacks are victimized are the result of White racism and older Blacks will witness more repressive measures than can be imagined. The Black and White community must face the fact that the entire authoritarian system of repression by the police forces of this country must be changed.The repressive measures extend from the top echelon of the police system and the officer on the beat is as afraid of reprisals inside the police system as the man on the street.An example of repression and reprisal was shown to the city last November. A tremendous drama was played on the stage of the Sacramento Bee and local T.V. stations. The battle for the Sheriffs office by Sheriff Duane Lowe (our present Sacramento County sheriff) and former Sheriff John Misterly. Sacramento Blacks watched while timid officers came forth reluctantly, testified and were domoted. These same officers were rewarded for work well done after Duane Lowe took office. Most were promoted. Research your Sacramento Bee papers and the Black and White community can verify these facts. This writer can name officers in Sacramento who have changed conversations in the middle of statements when an officer of higher rank suddenly appeared on the scene.Any older Black can verify the facts, that prospects for San Quentin and Folsom are being formed in the Black Communities all over the country.Because of the lethargy of Black Churchmen, Black middle class, who seem unconcerned about the treatment of Black youngsters and are not attentive to the deep determination of the young Black to survive, the White man bullet awaits us in the near future.The Whites cannot and will not free Blacks unless we demand it.It is a fact and Black parents and White parents must face this fact and move on these issues.","1971",0,1

"281","Fleming, Thomas C",1971-06-05,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The Miranda decision in which a defendant who had been convicted of a crime, appealed and the appeals court ordered a new trial, has caused a sullen resentment among law enforcement officials, namely prosecutors and police officers. Judges, on the other hand, have become strict observers of the law and have seen to it that all defendants in criminal matters who appear before them have been informed of their basic rights.The courts have been loudly criticized by those police and prosecutors who have been too lazy to gather sufficient evidence to convict any person who has been unfortunate enough to have charges lodged against him by the police, then prosecuted in court by the prosecutor.Many judges have been castigated by persons engaged in law enforcement work, who have been nothing more than tormentors of the poor and other people without influence, because the judges have become very legal in the protection of all defendants. Some of the more choleric members of the general population were so enraged at one time that they publicly called for the impeachment of former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren.Warren earned the hatred of many law breakers, simply because he presided over the court in 1954, when the Supreme Court ordered the entire United States to provide quality education for Black youngsters. The decision is known as school desegregation.The term law-breakers was used very loosely above and it includes those persons who are supporters of that trite phrase known as law and order. Such persons have long defied all sections of the Constitution, the basic law of the land that provided full citizenship for Black Americans.The law and order people loudly deplore what they call the rising crime rate in the nation, but one would find few of them who deplore the activites of police officers who have made the most important part of police work the brutal treatment of any person who does not have any influence in any given city in the nation.Then there are the cheap chiselers among the law and order persons, like Ronald Reagan, who despite his visible salary and other assets found a cheap way to avoid the payment of a state income tax.The people of the nation who do not have influence are well aware of the activities of the real criminals. Few of the real criminals ever experience the humiliation of appearing before a judge for their obvious defiance of the law.A federal district court judge, Stanley Weigel, recently told the San Francisco School Board that it could no longer ignore the 1954 Supreme Court order to provide quality education for Black youngsters in the city.Judge Weigel was quite specific in his ruling. He stated that he San Francisco public schools must be totally desegregated come September 1971. Now, any logical person knows that it has been 16 years since the high court ordered desegregation. But San Francisco, a city which prides itself on being one of the few bastions of liberalism in the nation, still finds it necessary to exclude Black youngsters from institutions where they might benefit from the quality of education provided by such institutions.Some San Franciscans are so outraged that a group of them, who reside in sections of the city where it would be difficult to find any Blacks residing, formed a loose coalition, known as the Concerned Parents. The primary aim of the coalition is to keep the schools lily white despite any statement that they might make to the press.Concerned Parents have filed a motion in federal court asking a delay in the implementation of any form of desegregation. The plaintiffs' plea is that they need more time, but all that they are seeking is a way of circumventing a legal court order.It is a coincidence that the same people who formed Concerned Parents are the same people who support any form of police abuse towards Blacks, Chicanos and other persons who are without prestige or influence. Incidentally, they are so fouled up in their values that for the most part they bear strong dislikes for one another.Young Blacks and some young whites watch the activities of the organizations like Concerned Parents and realize that, through quasi-legal methods, laws are broken or ignored by people who make shibboleths about their strict observation of the law.It is hard for the young people, whether Black or white, to believe that they are breaking laws when they smoke pot, engage in sexual freedom, demonstrate against a needless war or oppose racism and poverty. Let the young people gather in peaceful assembly to protest the inequites of the legal system, they often find themselves arrested and charged with crimes.The attorney general of the United States and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation break laws all of the time, but neither man is ever punished. The attorney general and the director of the FBI bug the telephones of many citizens in the nation, despite sections of the Constitution in Washington, the police, acting on orders from the attorney general, arrested practically everyone they saw on the streets during the demonstration.These are some of the reasons why the young people are so cynical about law enforcement. The young dissenters feel that if the law and order people can flout the laws, then it is also their constitutional right to flout any so called law which they feel is obnoxious.","1971",0,1

But, as his mother says, ""Zachery seems much older and wiser than his five years. Often his knowledge of things and his awareness of what goes on around him surprises us.""For the next twelve months Zachery's alert and ready smile will represent the essential spirit of the child with epilepsy. He will symbolize the majority of typically active, intelligent, freindly youngsters who are just like all boys and girls -- except that they happen to have an occasional seizure.As in previous years, the Contest attracted entries from all over the country.

"291","Curtis, Emory",1972-09-30,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Does growing widespread acceptance of unethical, and even illegal acts, by highly-placed officials bode ill for us? I think so.We are a highly visible minority in this country; an ineffective minority without economic or political power; a natural scapegoat for any real or imagined problems the dominant majority faces.And when the imagined threat bugs them enough, they may do something about it. It's happened before. The Germans and the Jews are a case in point. And then right here at home, there's White America's treatment of the Americans of Japanese ancestry who were placed in detention camps in World War II. The recent NBC TV show, ""Guilty by Reason of Race,"" brought out that whole situation right out in front. tion right out front.The only reason it doesn't happen often is because of a level of ethics, or sense of fair play, that keeps the baser side of the majority in check.That's why I'm concerned about our accepting shady behavior in high places. It brings on an ""anything goes that you can get by with"" mentality from top to bottom in our society. That attitude will let them take drastic action on us and then justify the immoral act -- just as they did the Japanese Americans during World War II.The trend toward unethical conduct needs to be stopped and a good place to start stopping it is with public officials who abuse public trust.There seems to be plenty of places to start -- at the top.The Committee to Re-elect the President has been caught red - handed financing burglars and destroying the incriminating bugging and financial records; the Commander of the Air Force in Southeast Asia ordered unauthorized bombings and commanded his troops to falsify the reports; the FBI chief in L.A. has been caught bugging phones illegally; the Department of Agriculture tipped off major grain exporters to the impending $750 million Russian wheat deal and denied it and then admitted it, and who knows what else.And no one with the power to chastise the culprits seems overly concerned. Maybe it is because they are all part of it. And then the American people seem to accept that type of action by our government as ""normal behavior.""With all of those shenanigans going at the national level, is it any wonder that so much ""ripping off"" of programs occurs in our communities?It's to be expected. The moral tone is set by the top leadership; what they do and how they act is the ""standard behavior."" And there will always be a large group that picks the lowest ""standard of behavior"" to emulate.That's why it was such a dark day for us when President Nixon got off the equal education school bus to pick up the white anti-integration votes.By doing that he established a new ""standard of behavior"" that legitimately moralized the Wallace - crowd's view of the school situation. Nixon is the first U.S. President in recent times to cloak the mantle of morality around a separatist school system.After that, it was a short step for the President to undermine the quota system of hiring on government funded projects. The quota system is just a small step along the ""catch-up"" road we have to travel to get equal employment.And in doing it, the President moralized his actions in the interests of society, even us -- just as they explained away the treatment of the Japanese - Americans in the 40's.However, neither morality nor the interests of society had much to do with the president's stand on that issue. The votes of the white construction workers and, of all things, the Jewish vote, were the basic causes of the President's opposition to the ""quota system.""And in order to try to grab Jewish vote, McGovern goes along with Nixon on that issue.With all of this slipping and sliding and condoning unethical behavior, it's refreshing to find a politician who actually acts as if laws were made to be upheld and that ethical behavior should be a way of life, in public office.Yes, there's one. Gerry Brown, the California Secretary of State. Gerry has forced politicians to report their spendings, as the law requires; when they didn't, he went after them -- Republicans and Democrats alike. Now he's going after those propositions that were illegally put on the ballot. He's a refreshing new wind in politics. I hope it blows harder.It needs to because the gap between morality and legality in this country is increasing, and along with it, the gap between White and Black and rich and poor.

"292","Jordan, Vernon E",1972-10-12,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","In the past several weeks I have spoken at commencement exercises at six Black colleges and universities in the South and it has been an exhilarating experience.Just standing on the platform and looking out at the sea of bright faces of graduates, their proud parents, and their friends is a moving experience. So, too, is the realization of what that great moment means to those youngsters, who have struggled to complete their education in the face of a lifetime of poverty, hardship and discrimination.Most are poor; 70 percent come from families whose total income is less than $5,000 per year and the overwhelming majority are the first in their families to graduate from college.Even without the statistics, you know this from the faces of their parents. Their look of joy and the tears of pride welling in their eyes tell the story of the sacrifices made and dreams fulfilled. You can see the faces etched with the lines of time and struggle breaking into joyous smiles as their beloved children clutch that degree that marks the pass-key to a better life.For many white families of college graduates, the majority probably, a college degree is a continuation of a family tradition, or a long taken-for-granted event. But for the parents of these Black youngsters graduating from the Black colleges of the South, that degree means their children will be freed from the burdens of field labor, of hard, brutal physical labor, of powerlessness.There is no question but that our society views a college degree as an entry permit to the middle class, an exit gate from the prison of poverty. The young men and women graduating today have far more opportunities than their forebears. I can recall, as recently as 1960, graduating from Howard Law and getting a job that paid $35 a week. Today, corporate recruiters are common on Black college campuses and opportunities have grown. That college degree is now a ticket to an instant living wage.But while the opportunities for these young people have expanded, they still have to deal with racism. They graduate at a time when the country seems to be turning its back on the evils of discrimination and racism; at a time when they must not only swim against the tide of overt discrimination, but also of that neglect and indifference which is often even more insidious.My impression of these young people is that they are fully aware of the challenges and that they've developed a toughness in dealing with issues of race that their elders could well envy. They're a sophisticated group that knows it has a charge to keep and a duty to perform that goes well beyond the merely personal strivings so common to our society.'We End To Begin'This was perhaps best summed up for me at Tougaloo College, in Mississippi, where the Senior class valedictorian said that ""we end to begin."" He meant that he and his fellow-graduates were ending their stay at Tougaloo, but were now embarking on the beginning of a life-time of service to their Black brothers in the urban and rural ghettos of the land.This consciousness of using their education on behalf of all Black and Brown Americans and thus for the benefit of the entire nation is among the most inspiring aspects of these commencements. You get the feeling that while so many Americans are hung up on an orgy of consumerism, or cut themselves off from concern about their society, that here are the best of America's youth avidly grasping the challenges facing them and their country.It's fairly common these days to hear people make disparaging remarks about the struggling Black colleges of this land. But if there are any doubters as to the value and importance of the Black colleges, let them come to one of these commencements and let them feel how hundreds of souls vibrate as one to the deepest longings of the people. It would take a hard heart and an empty mind to miss the importance and relevance of these schools which constitute a national treasure of the first order.","1972",1,0

This incident occurred last month on an Ets-Hokin property at 880 Oak St.Neil Webb, a disabled worker, fell behind on his June rent when disability checks were late in the mail. Webb pays $150 a month for a one-bedroom place where he lives with his wife and children, ages three and four.June 15, James Maxwell, an employee of Ets-Hokin came to the apartment around 10 p.m. Maxwell questioned the tenant about the overdue rent and left.June 27, shortly after mid-night, Webb said Maxwell and Abe Kaufmann, another Ets- Hokin employee, came to the door. Webb claims he was ""grabbed on the chest. . .my kids started yelling and screaming.""Webb said he told Maxwell to back off. When Maxwell failed to comply, Webb punched him. A brief scuffle ensued.Webb alleges James Maxwell was drunk and he turned to his partner saying, ""Abe, give me your gun. Let me shoot the nigger."" Kaufmann then pulled Maxwell away.Webb said he filed a complaint with the security officer for Applied Urbanology, an Ets-Hokin housing scheme located at 420 Pierce St. Nothing came of the complaint.James Ross, a former Ets-Hokin employee, claims Nathaniel Harvey, an Applied Urbanology official ""threw the complaint in his wastebasket.""Webb says he has not paid rent for June and July because his disability checks have not arrived. He said he has continued to receive threatening calls from Maxwell. July 20, he was given an eviction notice. Webb says as soon as he returns to work, he will find a new home.Former employee, Ross, is being sued by Ets-Hokin for non-payment of rent. His case will come before Judge Joseph Kennedy, July 28, at 9:45 a.m. in Room 310 at City Hall.SUPERVISORS MEETJuly 24, the Board of Supervisors gave the high-strung loquacious developer permission to begin his $50 million project. The site which now houses carnival rides, game rooms and restaurants will soon disappear. In its place will rise a commercial center and twelve-story apartment building.The supervisors scheduled the hearing after a sufficient number of residents in the area signed petitions opposing the project. The supervisor's chambers were overflowing. Opponents of the development were balanced by a vocal section supporting Ets-Hokin.The supervisors listened to four hours of testimony. Critics of the project presented a weak case and 'no' votes on the 11-member Board seemed to change. Supervisors Ronald Pelosi and Roger Boas, both seeking other offices this fall, opposed Ets-Hokin. Quentin Kopp did not participate since he is involved in a lawsuit against Ets-Hokin. The opponents zero'd in on the environmental damage to the area. One botanist told the supervisors how a rare species of plant will disappear when Ets-Hokin's bull-dozers go to work.Spokesmen for environmental groups and several citizens argued against the project. However, the supervisors are thinking in terms of dollars and were scarcely impressed by arguments about environmental damage.The Ets-Hokin development hopes to attract middle-income citizens to the beach. Critics pointed out potential costs of an Ets-Hokin unit are beyond middle-class potential. Figures such as $413 a month and $59,000 for apartment ownership were tossed around.People arguing against a 12-story building on the city's Pacific corner said no section of San Francisco is safe against the skyscraper. Two ladies from New York told the Board they came west to escape skyscrapers and are utterly dismayed by the changes in the city's skyline.The opponents spoke two hours. Little was said about Est-Hokin's controversial dealings in the Western Addition. Several area residents attended the meeting and restricted their words to curses from the back of the room.Ted Walker, a black man and former Muni driver, vaguely alluded to Ets-Hokin's Western Addition reputation. He termed the project a ""monstrosity"" and made sarcastic references to the Board's unwillingness to deal with the people.Whenever Ets-Hokin, one of his salaried people, or a supporter opened his mouth, he was greeted with cheers, whistles, and raucous approval.Employees of the developer, disputed the contention that the environment would be damaged. This testimony came even though the entire Sutro Heights hill, 24,000 sq. feet, will be carved out of the earth.Residents supporting Ets-Hokin spoke of vandalism, crime and unsavory elements that are frequent at Playland at the Beach. They hope the project will eliminate the alleged problem. It undoubtedly will.

Brother Mel Anderson, St. Mary's president, described Johnson as ""a very charming guy, personable and articulate,"" but said he was being dismissed because his work was not satisfactory.The request for clarification of Johnson's status comes from two student groups at St. Mary's--the Black Student Union and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano Aztlan, known as MECHA, which is comprised of Chicano students in the southwestern states.Spokesmen for the student organizations have also expressed their distress over the announced dismissal of four part-time minority instructors--two Black, one Chicano and one a native of El Salvador.They were being dismissed, college officials explained, because of budget problems which necessitated a 5 percent out in the college's $3.5 million budget in expectation of declining enrollments and less income.Rather than eliminate any of the 88 lay and 25 clerical faculty members, the administration decided to decrease the number of part-time instructors.As a result, said a BSU spokesman, St. Mary's will have only two full-time and three part-time minority persons on its faculty.PROPORTIONOf the 1,190 students now enrolled at St. Mary's, approximately one in seven--or 180--are members of minority groups, divided almost equally between Blacks and Chicanos.According to the administration, of the $250,000 allotted to scholarships, approximately half is given to minority students although they represent only 18 percent of the student body.. . . at . . . is $1,896 a year.

Who took me to my first championship fight when I was six. And taught me both to love and keep a close eye on The Manly Art.""(For a review of this book, see the Sports Section of this paper.)Budd Schulberg was in town last week to talk about this book, about Muhammad Ali in general, (Schulberg had just returned from Vancouver where had just witnessed Ali's decisive victory over George Chuvalo) and about his life-long interest in boxing. About Ali's Vancouver fight, Schulberg said that after the fight he spent the rest of the evening talking with Ali. ""He was very philosophical about not knocking Chuvalo out,"" recalled the writer who also admitted that he himself had predicted on the ""Today"" show that Ali would knock out Chuvalo. Ali even said he thought he had him (Chuvalo) in the sixth round. He is, however, quite confident about his return bout with Frazier which is tentatively scheduled for late summer.Schulberg has long been a friend, fan and follower of Muhammad Ali and his book emphatically brings out that this friendship and fan admiration extends far beyond Ali as a fighter but encompasses Muhammad Ali as a human being. His book will undoubtedly be called biased by bigots. In fact, the very first letter he got concerning his book was a blast from a bigoted redneck, he related.Schulberg, whose interest and expertise on boxing obviously goes back to that period when he saw his first fight at six years of age, has covered Ali's career from its earliest days through that shameful period when he was unjustly stripped of his championship title and on up to his fight with Frazier. He began making notes for his present book ever since Ali started preparing for his fight in Atlanta with Quarry. His coverage of the Atlanta fight scene is one of the highlights of the book in this writer's opinion.

They've tried getting answers from their parents from dope and from the hippie thing.""They became militant and went into the revolution thing and that didn't do it, so a lot of them went into the Jesus movement. That's what brought on the popularity of gospel music, and that's what's going to keep it popular.""Clark feels that the appeal of gospel music transcends the traditional bounds of race or religion. ""They're not treating the recordings as ""gospel"" records; not putting them into any particular ethnic group market. White kids are able to relate to the truth behind the songs, and the emotional feeling. Black kids see them as a reflection of the Black experience. But everybody can relate to the spiritual and musical value of gospel records.Clark points to the success of Stax' Staple Singers as an example of how gospel performers are enjoying new popularity. ""The Staples have been able to sell single records and albums in the millions. And you know that it's not all older people, or even all Blacks, who are buying 'Respect Yourself,' 'I'll Take You There' or any of their other hits. It's predominantly young people who come to see the group perform now, too. Black and white.""The Gospel Truth Label, just a year old, already has a strong catalog including albums by such artists as the Rance Allen Singers, Maceo Woods and Howard Lemon Singers. And many more, Clark emphasizes, are on the way.""I think that we kind of woke up the other companies to gospel, but it's a challenge."" Clark grins, with the self-assurance of a man who knows his business inside out, ""Competition just makes the whole business better.""","1972",0,0
"300","",1972-06-08,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","A definite upsurge in Senator George McGovern's popularity among Black voters was effected in California over the past few weeks of his campaigning, not only by the tremendous endorsement of Black leaders within the State, but also by the stirring presence of Movement leaders of national prominence, such as Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and the Hon. Julian Bond.Before these two significant occurrances, McGovern forces were saddled with a knowledge from polls showing that they could only hope to attain a fraction less than 20% of the Black vote that was being cornered by the candidacy of former Vice-President and now Senator, Hubert H. Humphrey, and Black Congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm.The surprising and historic endorsement of Sen. McGovern by Mrs. King, which marked the Senator's first campaign appearance in Southern California, weighed heavily on the leadership of the Black Church, long a bastion of political influence in the Black community, and with other Black political and community leaders who were visibly and vocally swayed by her sincerity.Mrs. King's endorsement was followed by the presence of the dynamic Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, President of the Chicago-based Operation PUSH. His influence weighed heavily with both young and old, rich and poor, throughout the state.Rev. Jackson entered California from the North by visiting Richmond, Oakland and San Francisco, before he came south to stump Los Angeles and San Diego in behalf of the South Dakota Senator.Following Mrs. King and Rev. Jackson, was the Hon. Julian Bond, Georgia State Representative, who brought his eloquence and his vital political image to the state for McGovern.Mrs. King's endorsement statement which ran 6-1/2 pages, is now slated to become one of the most historic and persuasive documents to be authored by a Black leader whose influence knows neither ethnic nor philosophic boundaries.In addition to meeting with ministers and their wives in Los Angeles with Rev. Jackson and Sen. McGovern, Mrs. King journied to Oakland and San Francisco to meet Northern California ministers and business professionals with their wives.Rev. Jackson toured college campuses and met with community and political leaders in turning the tide from the well-known Humphrey to the lesser known McGovern.The Hon. Mr. Bond took his campaigning into the neighborhoods of Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as to the youth in colleges and high schools of those two cities.At election time, the polls showed that Senator McGovern was favored to capture about more than 45% of the Black voters, resulting from the rapid swing brought by Mrs. King, Rev. Jackson and the Hon. Bond and the many local California leaders.The three national leaders were firm in their support of Sen. McGovern as the candidate who was willing to deal with the Black Agenda:1.) We need and want jobs.2.) We need and want a humane and adequate alternative to a degrading welfare system.3.) We need and want a public education system that is free . . . free of guns, dope and liquor.4.) We need and want a comprehensive health plan for all people.5.) We need and want a guaranteed end to the unwanted and immoral Vietnam war.6.) We need and want an equitable tax program that makes sure the rich and the corporations pay their fair share of the nation's burden.7.) We need and want a President whose integrity and intelligence molds his conviction to save our nation by presiding over and for all Americans in one household.In two weeks Sen. McGovern turned from a virtually unknown candidate among the Black voters into the winning candidate. Black Californians responded not only locally, but throughout the State, by going to the polls for McGovern in this week's Presidential Primary.","1972",1,0

John Tunney (D-Calif), principal sponsor of the legislation, delivered his notice that he would fight for the full $115 million marked for research, treatment, counseling and educational programs for the next three years.The bill which did not have a single vote cast against its passage in the House or the Senate, set a spending target of $25 million within the first year starting July 1, 1972.Upon the signing of the bill, the President mentioned the sum of $15 million outlay for the next fiscal year - an increase of $5 million, he noted, over current spending and $1 million over last year's level.Congressional supporters of the bill charged that the level proposed by the President, was far too low in comparison to the severity of the disease.Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass), blasted the President's proposal during a Congressional hearing by stating that if the victim were white, the legislation would have been provided long ago.Tunney plans to testify before the Senate appropriations committee and request and demand ""full"" funding. ""The suffering and despair of the victims of sickle cell anemia, compounded by tragic ignorance of the disease by many Americans, demands that the Federal Government now match the words in this new law with the money to make it work.""Sickle Cell is a blood disease inherited, for which there is no present cure, but researchers hope to find one, provided they receive the funds needed to continue present and future research.Sickle Cell is believed to have been self - developed by Black African countries centuries ago as a natural defense against malaria. It is also found in other tropical zones as well as Asia and Southern Europe.The disease kills half of its victims before the age of 20; few survive beyond the age of 40; and most are crippled long before their death. More than 50,000 Americans of African ancestry are believed to be suffering from the killer at this time, and as many as 2.5 million are suspected of being carriers of the trait, which if not controlled could effect future generations.The disease has the following symptoms: stunted growth, pain, swelling of the joints, hemorrhage and tissue death. The disease impairs the normal cell shape, which is round, into a crescent which makes the flow of blood through the vital organs.Only those children born from parents, who themselves both, carry the trait will be exposed to the 1-in-4 chances of being stricken down with the killer. Mecical experts estimate it would cost about $30 million to screen all Americans who are potential victims or carriers of the Sickle Cell trait.A major program of public information is planned to heighten awareness of the disease. Congressional committees have been told that afflictions in many cases have been diagnosed.","1972",1,0

If enacted, the bill would provide parents of students in nonpublic, nonprofit elementary and secondary schools a credit of up to $200 against their income taxes for tuition paid to those schools.""This new legislation would amount to a loss in revenue to the government of $790 million per year at a time when funds are not being increased and, in many cases, are being cut for needed programs in the public schools,"" said Mrs. Walter G. Kimmel, National PTA Coordinator of Legislative Activity. She referred specifically to the veto of the recent Congressional appropriation for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.Mrs. Kimmel explained that it was assumed in the hearings that nonpublic schools will raise their tuition at least by the amount of the $200 granted the parents. ""We believe this is indirect aid to nonpublic schools,"" she added.The legislative program of the National PTA has for many years stipulated the ""federal funds for the education of children and youth should be used only by public boards and departments."" The PTA has consistently opposed any legislation that would channel money into nonpublic schools and for the same reasons, has opposed the use of vouchers in the schools.The National PTA believes that the right of the nonpublic school to be selective of its students often forces the poor and the Black, as well as children with special needs, into the public school system. As more parents are encouraged to send their children to nonpublic schools, the general public becomes less willing to provide adequate support for public schools.Mrs. Kimmel has urged all state PTA legislative chairmen to voice their opposition to H.R. 16141. ""And when we begin to flex our muscles, things start happening,"" she said.

The studio says the demand for information pictures and feature stories about the film and RICHARD ROUNDTREE has been overwhelming as have requests for personal appearances by the star. And now that MGM will release the ""Shaft"" sequel, ""SHAFT'S BIG SCORE,"" in little more than a month, it feels it can better disperse information about the star and the movie under the leadership of a national coordinator.

About all I can personally add to that is my impression of RICHARD ROUNDTREE as being the sort of guy who deserves this rather special treatment and attention. I met Roundtree on the set at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York several weeks ago when filming was nearing completion and I found him a very personable guy and totally without affectation over his sudden and phenomenal success.

Years of talk and paper shuffling had caused Judge Weigel to take action. He ordered integration to be achieved in June; September was the deadline.Mary Rogers, head of the Raphael Weill School Community Organization, says ""We're concerned with what's at the end of the bus ride. You want to see more than polka dot classrooms. You go to school to learn to live within the society us old foggies built.""Joan Barr works for the Human Rights Commission of San Francisco. ""Busing is only a means to an end. The community used it as a red herring. Let's face it, a lot of people are racist! Busing is nothing new. People should be asking will better education come through de - segregation.""Western Addition people would like to spend more time on improving conditions in their schools. But too much time is taken on such activities as stopping School's Superintendent Shaheen from firing all 140 bus monitors Jan. 28.San Francisco County was divided into seven zones to facilitate Judge Weigel's integration decision. Fillmore Western Addition is in Zone II with seven elementary schools.In the Fillmore educational projects were curtailed to obstensibly pay for purchases of school buses, drivers, monitors and related necessities. The Raphael Weill Community Organization lost its two year old individualized education subsidy of some $152,000.Mary Rogers scoffs at the idea that no funds are available. She steadfastly maintains there is $200,000 in excess to resurrect the Raphael Weill project and much more. She is upset that monitors will go off the buses, and thinks more funds could be released by paring down the administration end of schools.Mrs. Rogers is highly critical of Mayor Alioto. She claims he was and is not interested in seeing San Francisco schools desegregated. She points to recent Board of Education appointments by the mayor which have installed de - segregation foes as the city's top educational decision makers.Looking forward, Mrs. Rogers thoughts are mixed. In June San Francisco voters will elect a Board of Education as they did the Supervisors last November. It will be the first elected board in city history. ""In June you will have right-wing conservatives on the board and black, brown minority people can kiss it goodbye.""Mary Rogers is happy the children enjoy school somewhat oblivious to their parents goingson. Black people are increasingly interested in the quality and administration of education in San Francisco, and Mrs. Rogers says she can get as many parents as necessary involved in school activities.Eugene Hopp was recently appointed to the Board of Education and validates Mrs. Rogers' fears about the school board. Hopp has spoken out strongly against busing and says ""What we all want is good education for our children and we're not going to get it on the bus.""Hopp would rather spend desegregation monies on such activities as music and athletics. Hopp is not satisfied that Judge Weigel's de - segregation decision is the final word and has received assurances that city hall administrators are looking into the issue. Mayor Alioto's City Attorney, Thomas M. O'Connor recently made the first arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals, as the city attempts to reverse Judge Weigel's desegregation decision.Arguments continue downtown while a group begins to assess the effects of de - segregation. The Community Service and Information Bureau works on Sutter at the NAACP headquarters. They received a $60,000 grant from HEW in Washington, D.C., to act as a third party to work out disputes between schools, parents and children, and they have one officer for each of the seven schools in Zone II. It is possible that this grant will be consumed mainly by such administrative costs.De-segregation in San Francisco has worked well as long as one looks only at integration figures and speaks with children. 39.3% of students in Zone II, encompassing Fillmore and Western Addition, Treasure Island, Pacific Heights and Chinatown, are white. The remaining 60% is divided between black and third world children.Significant forces are at work actively encouraging de-segregation but they have strong opponents in the city administration. As controversies arise, the decision maker will have to be San Francisco's 704,000 people. Article copyright Reporter Publishing Co.Photo","1972",1,0
"318","Taylor, Gina",1972-09-23,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","It seems to be an ongoing thing for some sisters to remark these days ""Brothers are Bad."" Not only in reference to good looks but the new-found 'Black awareness' that brothers, in growing numbers are beginning to express openly.One such 'bad brother' is Berkeley city councilman D' Army Bailey. Upon meeting Bailey, one is immediately impressed with what he's constructively doing with his blackness.At 30 years of age Bailey, who holds a law degree from Yale, has played a major role in leading Berkeley's city council into an unparalleled history of change.Since April, 1971, the council, which has three other Black members: Mayor Warren Widener, Wilmont Sweeney, and Ira Simmons, has for starters removed the U.S. flag from City Hall, permitted policemen to grow their hair, implemented child care centers, cut off funds for the Chamber of Commerce, and supported the Marijuana Initiative.Several weeks ago, Bailey introduced a resolution which condemned the use of any arm of our local, state or national government to support or protect those who are working against the interest of the people of the Republic of South Africa.Though many have labeled him a radical, Bailey considers radicalism a term that the mass media came up with. ""I consider myself a Black nationalist,"" Bailey said.Bailey doesn't feel that the Black community of Berkeley is any different than any other Black community across the nation, therefore the needs of all Black communities are basically the same. One problem is: ""Economic subjugation. Economics are controlled by whites who have no basic commitments to poor people or Third World people."" Education is also another problem. ""Education is a reflection of white culture. It is a detriment to us. Black children must be educated in a way in which education is shown as it relates to Black people. Black kids are three years behind,"" Bailey said.""You must realize that the existing political system is maintained to keep those in power,"" Bailey added.Speaking on his role in the city council, Bailey explained that he and two other Blacks on the council have a basic commitment to Black people. The two others being Mayor Warren Widener and Ira Simmons.Bailey claims that Sweeney, the fourth Black person on the council, does the bidding of the white conservatives. ""When I wanted six blacks hired in permanent jobs, he voted against it, saying it would be discrimination in hiring,"" Bailey said.Bailey stated that he is against the majority rule issues because it would prevent block voting by Blacks. The majority rule would give white people a veto power. In order for a black person to get elected he would have to get 23% of the white vote. This will create weak, wishy - washy, mealy-mouth, subservient, bootlickers like Wilmont Sweeney,"" Bailey said.Bailey is not that interested in the campaign presidential race in '72. ""There's not much difference between McGovern and Nixon. I think McGovern is basically a phony. He's got a few Blacks fronting for him in the community. The Presidency is the height of contradiction. Any Black person who is enthusiastic about the Presidential race is a fool. Nixon is certainly not interested in Black people,"" Bailey explained. At the present time a move is underway in Berkeley to recall several members of the city council and one primary target is Bailey.In a speech before the Commonwealth Club of California, Michael Culbert, editor of the Berkeley Gazette, told the businessmen: ""If Berkeley is to survive, some sort of moderation must be achieved. Two current attempts are: (1) The Berkeley Recall Committee which is initiating recall of one of the radicals; (2) The majority run-off proposition on Berkeley's Nov. 7 ballot which, if passed, would insure that minority candidates could not be elected because of splintering. However, these are only two possibilities in a wide range. Nothing will work to deter this rampant radicalism unless Berkeley's solid citizenry begins to act immediately.""So the recall efforts continue. Congressman Ron Dellums has said, according to Bailey's reliable sources, that he will . . . in neutral if only Simmons and Bailey are recalled, and that if Widener and Hancock are also recalled, he will then intervene.But it's quite likely that D' Army Bailey will be able to handle any unusual issue that confronts him. Cause 'Brothers are unusually Bad' and D'Army Bailey is no exception.Photo (D'Army Bailey)","1972",1,0

Miller.Luis G. Nogales, assistant to President Richard W. Lyman, will succeed Robert M. Nelson, former director of personnel and employee relations, as the University affirmative action officer, serving as official liaison between the university and government agencies in this field.Arthur Bienenstock, associate professor of materials science and applied physics, will supervise faculty affirmative action programs and administer a $75,000 fund for this purpose as a member of the provost's staff.In the past, official responsibility for implementing affirmative action programs has rested entirely on the personnel department. As affirmative action officer, Nogales will seek to organize affirmative action coordinators within individual departments of the university.The resources of internal audit, personnel and legal counsel will be available to him to monitor progress, Minority employment representatives and others in the personnel department will concentrate their efforts on recruitment, training and development programs for affirmative action.Professor Bienenstock's duties will include setting up procedures with deans and department chairmen for recruitment of ethnic minority and female faculty members.He will also be responsible for reviewing procedures with deans to make certain that present classification and wage scales for women academic employees are appropriate for given individuals.REVIEW EXPECTEDIn a report announcing the appointments and outlining the affirmative action programs at Stanford, Provost Miller told the faculty senate.""It is clear we will have further review by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare.""HEW is obligated to review all major institutions and they have indicated we are on their list to be reviewed. The timetable for this has not yet been established. It clearly depends on their workload at other institutions.""Past experience indicates they will search out inequities in pay or advancement in female and ethnic minority faculty and they will demand the hiring of more female and minority faculty. They may, for instance, demand that a fixed percentage of all new hires be minorities or women. How we meet the demands will depend on the form of their proposals....""We are enthusiastic about the ideals of the affirmative action program, but we are also anxious to maintain the academic quality of the faculty.""We believe that both of these goals are possible with careful planning and activity. There are increasing numbers of outstanding minority faculty and women available. The competition is very severe. For this reason, we believe that aggressive searches at the departmental level for outstanding candidates must be the most important part of this program.""CLARIFIES A POINTDiscussing how the $75,000 affirmative action fund could be used to help meet this objective, he noted that ""a department may see an outstanding candidate now, but not have an opening for a year because that is when the oldest faculty member retires. The fund could be used to pay part or perhaps all of the salary"" for an affirmative action appointment in the interim.","1972",1,0

They seem more into the idea of entertaining their audiences as opposed to just performing for the sake of performance.Don Thompson (apparently the leader), draped in a fur coat, and hugging his guitar most of the time as if it was human, did most of the vocals and the emceeing. Virgil harmonized with him on several of the tunes. Thompson sings in a low and sometimes high crisp sounding voice and he plays his guitar with spirit. His guitar's introductions to songs (especially ""Soul Man"") were usually single note solos followed by twanging chords.Timmy Jones tends to throw many effects into his accompanies and solos (including some of Jimmy Smith's tricks), but he's a good organist and plays with a solid beat and does yeoman footwork. His playing was powerful and inventive yet unobtrusive, doing all sorts of interesting things behind Don and Rucker's singing but not drawing any attention away from them.Virgil Rucker keeps the time here it should be at throughout a tune doing a splendid job with his rhythm. It was a pleasure to listen to his musical dialogue with Don. He not only drives the trio but his playing is sometimes so sensitive and musical that he seems to be reading Don and Jones' minds.I really dug their 15 minute version of ""The Love We Had."" It was so moving, it brought every couple in the house to the dance floor.In talking with Don after the gig, I discovered they have been together for two and a half years and half of that time, they have been featured at the New Royce Club. They have a recording that was released last month on the D T & V Label.They are an exciting trio, and if you like good music to dance to and a cozy little place to dance in, you'll like Dawn and Sunset and the New Royce Club.

"324","Berkley, Thomas L",1972-06-08,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Post-Primary AnalysitsFor the last 10 days things have been more than hectic around the office of The POST. It was just about the 25th of May that I belatedly accepted an invitation to become cochairman for Senator Hubert H. Humphrey's California campaign. Of course, I didn't have to do that. I could have stood on the sidelines and waited, like a lot of my friends did, especially after it was obvious that there was a great groundswell for the McGovern forces and that Senator George McGovern was without a doubt the frontrunner at that stage of the campaign. I couldn't do this because I have had a long and continuous association with Senator Humphrey, and an understanding of his great record in the field of Civil Rights and his identification with Black and brown people. Besides that, a man doesn't always fight to win. He fights for what he believes and in an effort to establish a posture for the future. I suppose if I had followed the admonition of many of the workers at The POST--and there were many McGovernites here--I could have easily been on the winning side and been in Los Angeles this week whooping it up with the heady McGovern victors. But as my grandmother used to say, ""all sickness isn't death."" The race is not always to the swift but to him that endureth to the end. Enduring to the end means two more hurdles for any person seeking office who has been possessed by Pootomac fever--one, the Democratic National Convention in Miami and two, the ultimate test in November when the parties clash headon.That Certain FeelingI have no personal regrets for my obviously partisan activity during the primary. I have had the opportunity in the past to enjoy the excitement of an under-dog victory in the Democratic primary. Such was my opportunity when I was co-chairman of Pierre Salinger's campaign against Alan Cranston in a knock, down-dragout Democratic primary six years ago. Salinger won that one against all odds and was later appointed Senator by then-Governor Pat Brown upon the death of then-incumbent Senator Clair Engle. I remember, too, in 1968 when Bobby Kennedy came out of Oregon suffering a humiating defeat and asked me to co-chair his campaign in Northern California. Here again we were against what appeared to be insurmoutable odds but were able to win the 1968 California delegation. We went to the Democratic Convention in Chicago without our leader, but the momentary thrill of victory is still well remembered.Problem of Closing RanksSenator McGovern's highest emotional satisfacion will come in the next couple of days when the full reality of what he has done and what he must do between now and the convention hits him. He is without a doubt the Democratic frontrunner. His organization worked harder, was better organized and had more money. But he must realize that he has only about 45% of the popular Democratic vote tentatively committed to him through his primary victories. To come out of Miami as the candidate, he will first have to make his peace with Big Labor, which won't be easy since he has voted for ""right to work"" legislation.Secondly, he will have to compromise his position in order to pick up the support of his fallen comrades, including New York Mayor John Lindsay, Senator Humphrey and Senator Edmund Muskie. Thirdly, McGovern will have to convince his organization that in making the necessary compromises, the is not breaking the high-sounding promises that were so appealing to the middle-class suburbanites and to the young people who are making such a strong contribution to his campaign. They would not have an easy relationship with a Southerner on the ticket as Vice President, something McGovern may well have to consider as he grapples with the problem of Governor George Wallace, who on foot and in hospital bed has been able to secure his position as the number 2 delegate holder in the Democratic Party.Wallace will be hard-headed, pragmatic and demanding, and has the ability to carry his vote to President Nixon in November. Undoubtedly, he will be the toughest broker of power at the convention, and his votes are probably more tightly identified with him than are any other candidate's votes. Lastly, it is hard to predict at this time what McGovern will do in order to woo the center-city Chicano and Black vote and to bring them into his camp in sufficient numbers to insure the kind of Democratic unity that will be needed in order for him to defeat Nixon.The 'Last Hurrahs'Meanwhile, it is obvious that President Nixon will not be sitting on his hands while all these maneuvers are being carried out by the Democratic contender, whoever he may be. It should be remembered by all of us that these are just the ""last hurrahs"" of the first stage of a three phase battle for the biggest prize of them all, the Presidency of the United States.Photo (Tom Berkley)","1972",1,0

They also act as a fashion accessory, like the right belt you would wear with pants or sweaters. Mr. Reuben's ""hairpiece wardrobe"" is intended to accomplish these things.It consists of a Dome Curlette which is placed at the crown of head, Afro Puffs and Curly Puffs which can be worn together or separately and run the gamut from casual to dressy. All three combined can give an endless variety of looks every day, 7 days a week, with a flick of the brush.Hair styles with a difference can be easily created with CURLY PUFFS Wear them---one over the other for a cascade effect.All of Summit's hairpieces are made of a unique fiber called Afrylic, a modacrylic fiber especially designed to simulate a Black woman's hair. Each comes with a 60-day warranty and complete care and washing instructions. A choice of five colors is available -- Black, Off Black, Dark Brown, Chestnut Brown and Auburn.CURLY PUFFS, so versatile, they've been called the ""hair piece wardrobe."" Soft, bouncy clusters of curls that go from casual wear to dress-up with a brush. Wear them paired or individually as pictured to feel cool, lovely and comfortable.Soft, bouncy loops of curls go from the casual to the romantic with a brush of the hair.Invent your individual look.

"328","",1972-11-08,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","OAKLAND--At POST presstime on Tuesday morning, November 7, only one thing was certain about Election Day, 1972.And that was that millions of voters -- many of them for the first time--were entering polling booths to register their choice on candidates and issues.In California 86 percent of the state's 10.4 million registered voters were expected to cast ballots, according to an estimate by Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. The nation's largest bloc of electoral votes--45--would go to the Presidential candidate of their choice.Last-minute national predictions ranged from a ""little"" to a huge landslide for President Nixon. One French newspaper said he would capture 48 states.Supporters of Senator George McGovern were hoping for a ""miracle"" wherein enough populous states would swing sufficient electoral votes to the Democratic challenger to send him to the White House even if he failed to get the highest popular vote.On election eve McGovern supporters were still discounting the polls, noting that virtually all of McGovern's early primary victories had been upsets and recalling President Harry Truman's surprise election in 1948 when Republican Thomas Dewey was considered a ""shoo-in"" and his victory not only predicted but actually announced.McGovern aides were expecting their candidate to capture most first-time votes, pointing out that a substantial majority of new voters had registered Democratic because ""they intended to vote Democratic.""It was also recalled that ""90 percent of new registrants vote"" -- much higher percentage than among old-timers, many of whom were expected to ""sit this one out.""Some observers expected a huge election turnout because of the more than 10 million new registrations since last spring. There were other predictions that while the number of votes cast might be the most ever, the percentage of registered voters going to the polls could very well follow the declining pattern of the past three Presidential elections.California's importance in the final returns was dramatized by both candidates, with President Nixon's election eve address coming from the Western White House and Senator McGovern returning for a final rally in Long Beach.There was general agreement, also, that the next House of Representatives would number among its 435 members three Black Congresswomen with Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of Los Angeles and Barbara Jordan of Texas joining a reelected Shirley Chisholm.","1972",0,0

Tuesday's action curtailing Muni railway service followed Monday's Board of Supervisors move cutting the parking tax in the city's parking lots.The eight supervisors who voted to cut the off street parking tax from 25 to ten percent can be only described as callous. The tax break, which will help out-of-town commuters, goes into effect July 1. By the supervisors' own admission, San Francisco will lose $2.8 million in sorely needed tax monies. If the eight supervisors who voted to give the commuters a tax break had come to Tuesday's Public Utilities Commission meeting they would have left with burnt ears.The P.U.C. was closely examined by 350 San Franciscans who wanted to know why the city cannot find $1.4 million to run its bus service. This question is certainly pertinent when eight supervisors had just voted to give up $2.8 million, in desperately needed revenues. The P.U.C. defended itself by saying the parking tax cut does not go into effect until July 1. So what? If San Francisco can afford to decrease taxes on its commute traffic, it certainly is inexcusable to curtail bus service for its own people.The P.U.C., whose five members have all been appointed by Mayor Alioto are only scapegoats for the worst kind of fiscal neglect at City Hall. Twice, in less than three years, the P.U.C. has raised bus fares with the empty promise things would get better.

More than 36 million American women can't, won't or hate to sew, according to a recent national report. Try as they might, their sewing endeavors are thwarted by broken needles, tangled threads and angled nerves.Time was when only their sewing sisters could save money on decorating. But conquering the complexities of a sewing machine is no longer a prerequisite to penny-wise decors, Today's self-adhering coverings, iron-on bindings and improved adhesives offer unlimited possibilities to the imaginative but non-sewing homemaker.A child's bedroom is the ideal spot for a fanciful flight into stitchless redecorating. Since tastes and interests change with maturity, the personality of his room should mirror his expanding horizons. More important than a large redecorating budget are a little do-it-yourself ingenuity and an adaptable furniture selection.With a versatile furniture style as a base, the non-sewer can cue the surrounding decor of her daugher's age bracket without bursting the budget. A doll's tea party corner, for instance, would delight any moppet. A can of bright paint can restore attic or rummage sale play pieces to child-pleasing newness while a girlish floral fabric or self-adhesive wall-paper can be pasted to one wall for a cheerful backdrop.More pre-teen misses love frankly feminine rooms with lots of frills, ruffles and bows, and the non-sewing mom can now indulge these fancies. Even the canopy--perhaps the ultimate feminine favorite--can be achieved without needle and thread. An open-ended hem can be made on a piece of fabric with iron-on binding. When this hem pocket is slipped over a rod or canopy frame and the fabric is gathered together, ruffles are the dainty result. To accomplish this effect, the fabric width must be one and one-half to two times the width of the frame or rod it goes on.Photo (Versatile desk-dressing table combination by Kemp can grow up with the modern miss.

"340","Dashner, Heather",1972-12-23,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","PART 1The Chilean people and the Allende government scored a decisive victory during the October battle initiated by the bourgeoisie to topple the Popular Unity coalition. Coordinating their attack very closely with the Kennecott copper embargo in France, the Chilean big money interests attempted to paralyze activity within the country by convincing small businessmen that the executive was planning to expropriate them and so it was necessary to strike to protect themselves.The 26-day strike, well-publicized throughout the world, began Oct. 12, with the truck and taxi owners blocking the roads and refusing to supply the cities with food and fuel. They were supposedly protesting UP plans to nationalize their trucks, something the government had not proposed. This supposed non-political strike was followed two days later by merchants closing their doors in ""solidarity"" with the ""union"" struggle of the truck owners. This threatened to leave the population without food. At the same time, the association of industrialists called for the factories to be closed down. All these co-called ""union"" actions (In Chile the employers' associations are called unions) were supported by the National Party whose new policy of ""civil resistance"" just happened to fall in line with the ""apolitical"" strike; and by the Christian Democratic Party leadership.But the government and the popular organizations were not slow to act. Immediately Allende called a state of emergency and announced that the army would open the roads and requisition any trucks not running. Volunteers from the drivers' union manned the requisitioned trucks and began replenishing the supply of foodstuffs in the cities. Then all food stores were ordered opened and those which didn't comply were crowbarred open and often run by their workers. Neighborhood organizations which were already in operation to watch prices in local stores began to take direct charge of the distribution of food at legal prices. Tens of thousands of students organized themselves into voluntary labor brigades and worked day after day loading trucks, unloading trains, keeping up the food, fuel, and medical supplies to the population. Women's groups organized the distribution of milk and medicines to working class neighborhoods. But, most important-not one factory owner was able to close his plant. The workers in those factories whose owners tried to shut down, took them over and kept on producing. Then they were requisitioned by the government. The workers formed committees to protect the factories from the opposition and there were constant guards posted. The mobilization of the people was incredible.What would be the attitude of the armed forces toward this clash? That was the question in everyone's mind. The Chilean army officers generally come from the middle class and not the oligarchy or bourgeoisie and the army officers generally come from the middle class and not the oligarchy or bourgeoisie, and the rank and file is drafted, and therefore from the urban working class, making it unlike many other Latin American armies. That, coupled with the Chilean army's long history of non-intervention in politics and support of the constitution has made it the one big unknown force in the revolutionary process here. Though the steps taken by the Popular Unity were all legal and constitutional, they had never been taken before in favor of the people and against the ruling class. The right, which had before screamed that government actions were 'illegal! illegal! illegal!"", during the strike began using the feebler word ""illegitimate."" saying that if Allende was not violating the letter of the law, he, and the popular parties and organizations, were violating its spirit.The army, however, stood firmly by the Popular Unity. Instead of taking the much-profesized step of usurping the executive power to ""restore order"" and in effect make a coup d'etat, it carried out to the letter the PU's policy.Moving into the strike's second week, the right began to pull out every weapon it had. The boards of directors of the professional guilds proclaimed a strike of their members-doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers were all to stay away from their posts. The reaction was varied. Some obeved the decision; many stayed away from their private practices, but, in the case of medical workers, refused to strike in their hours of public service. Still others formed the Patriotic Front-of Professionals, which was designed to fight the strike decreed by the guilds' directors and make sure that the services especially health services, were adequate for the public.If the capitalist right wing, which was directing the strike, couldn't shut the factories themselves and hadn't been able to convince the workers to do it for them, they could try to prevent the workers from getting to the plant. In the second week the association of privately--owned buses decided to strike. The reaction of the Popular Unity was to requisition many of the buses. The bus drivers' union supported the PU and drove the requisitioned buses and the state-owned buses on their regular routes. Also, flatbed trucks were used as buses and many people got back and forth to work holding on to each other to maintain their balance. The bus strike was thus settled after one day, and full service was back in effect by the end of the second week of the national crisis.Not having counted on such a forceful response from the Popular Unity, the right did not began creating street incidents until a few days after the beginning of the first strike. In Santiago's center and in its rich residential area, bands of youths put up barricades, knocked down street lamps, made fires and attacked buses which ran during the transit strike. The crowds were dispersed by the police and the army, and many were arrested.At the same time began a wave of sabotage throughout the country. In over 200 terrorist actions, railway lines were blown up, requisitioned trucks were chained together, their tires slashed and steering mechanisms broken, a factory was completely destroyed by fire. Only me organization of the workers into vilgilance committees kept other inumerable sabotage attempts from succeeding. Fires were put out saboteurs were caught with their weapons, and civilian guards kept would-be intruders out of garages and factories.At the same time, the leftist parties, notably the Socialists, began calling for the coordination of all local organizations-others' clubs, neighbors' associations, price-controlling groups, youth organizations, organizations - under a Community Command. This command, elected from amongst the smaller groups, would relationlize their activity. They would decide how to distribute food and fuel during the strike and, with an eye to the future, which stores would be supplied with goods.","1972",0,0

"342","",1972-01-27,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","It was Calvin Coolidge who said ""the business of America is business."" This was no mere philosophical generalization. As any student of American history knows, the relationship between business and the federal government has always been an intimate one. One does not have to look at recent federal legislation which guaranteed a major aircraft company $230 million in loans; all that is required is a casual study of the nation's economic history. It has only been recently that the federal government has shown active concern with small business, and even more recently with minority business. The federal government has used as its principal instrument in assisting minority business The Small Business Administration (SBA).Created by Congress in 1953, the SBA was assigned the principal responsibility for the continuous development of small business in the nation.The services of the agency range from disaster loans and management assistance to small business loans. The agency has developed a number of standards for determining which enterprises are eligible for assistance. Some businesses, specifically speculative firms, newspapers, magazines and real estate firms are ineligible for SBA assistance. Most other small businesses are eligible.In making lending decisions, the agency analyzes past earning records and the future prospects of the business to determine if the business has the capacity to repay the loan considered and other debts from anticipated profits.The Small Business Administration can be used for:*Business expansion, construction or conversion;*Purchases of machinery, equipment, facilities, supplies or material;*Working capital needs.For wholesalers, annual sales from $5 million to $15 million, again, depending on the industry.For retailers annual sales or receipts of not more than $5 million.For the construction business, annual sales or receipts of not more than $5 million averaged over a three-year period.Last year, the SBA loaned a total of $160 million to some 6,262 minority businesses. For this year, the SBA has made 7,776 minority loans for a total of $213 million.If the businessman needs money and cannot borrow on reasonable terms, the agency will consider either partial participation or may guarantee up to 90 percent of a bank loan. If the bank is unwilling to provide any funds, and if funds are available, the agency will consider lending the entire amount as a direct government loan. Most loans, however, are not direct and are done on a participation basis.In 1968 the SBA combined its efforts with those of commercial banks and private industry to begin the Minority Enterprise Program. The Minority Enterprise Program uses a corps of field representatives who are located in major cities. These representatives cooperate with local agencies to explain the SBA Program.The Minority Enterprise loans are processed under relaxed eligibility criteria, with emphasis placed upon the applicant's character and ability to repay the loan. Most of the loans advanced under this program are under the Guaranty Plan. Under this system, the bank advances the funds, with the SBA guaranteeing up to ninety per cent of the total.If you have an established business that is eligible for SBA assistance, the following steps should be followed:(1) Prepare a current financial statement listing assets and liabilities;(2) Prepare a profit and loss statement for the previous full year and for the current period to the date of the balance sheet;(3) Prepare a current financial statement of the owner, or each partner or stockholder owning 20 per cent or more of the corporate stock in the business;(4) List collateral to be offered as security for the loan, with your estimate of the present market value of each item listed;(5) The amount of the loan requested should be stated and purposes of its use explained;(6) This information should be taken to your banker. Ask for a direct bank loan, and if declined, ask the bank to make the loan under the SBA's Loan Guaranty Plan or to participate with the SBA in a loan.

Finley.Charlie O., the human, has a lot in common with Charlie O., the mule. Both are renowned for their unyielding stands.In fact, it has been noted in some circles that perhaps in stubbornest and downright orneriness, Finley could teach the mule a trick or two.Finley has offered Blue what he thinks is a reasonable salary and hell and the rest of the world could freeze over before he makes another offer.He firmly believes $50,000 is a sufficient increase for a second year pitcher who might get a case of sophomoritis.Quite a few ballplayers have been busts their second year in the majors and Finley undoubtedly can quote you a long list of names to substantiate his belief.Finley can easily afford to pay the money Blue and his attorney Robert Gerst are asking for the pitcher's services. It's not that at all. It's the principle of the whole thing.And Blue being a bonifide brother can understand the man's position.There was once a time when all the brothers had was principle. And they were taking what they could get which was not exactly the best nor right.Of course times have changed but not as much as Vida's advisors are telling him.Finley is offering Blue a $35,000 increase over his 1971 salary which amounts to an increase of over 200 per cent. How many people can reflect on the first year's salary after as many as 20 years on the same job and find their original salary has increased 200 per cent?To a man like Finley who has millions and is probably one of the richest men in the country, that's not sound business.Even the great Willie Mays reached his present astronomical wage by increments. Those increments were gradual and soon reached a plateau where the increases only satisfied the Internal Revenue service.If Blue has another year like last year or even better, he will certainly be considered for another raise. Considering the mathematics of the sum he is has been quoted as asking this year, Finley will be paying him over a million in two years.Another argument which starts the irascible LaPorte, Indiana resident fuming is Blue's negotiating through an intermediary.When the youngster was just out of high school in Mansfield, La., Charlie O. signed him to a contract with the Kansas City Athletics with a bonus of $45,000 and only his mother interceded.Contrastingly, Blue doesn't feel he is the originator of some surreptitious scheme to extort money from Finley. He knows he is a drawing.Since the beginning of the ball and bat game, good lefthanded pitchers have been a gate attraction like the circus' Wild Man from Borneo.Every baseball fan can name a few and each one already resides in baseball Valhalla. Fellows like Carl Hubbell, Herb Score, Robert Lefty Grove, and the incomparable Sandy Koufax. set the world afire in their heyday. And their worth was recorded at the turnstiles.Blue appears destined to surpass all of their exploits if last year was indication of the young man's future. He no doubt feels that he can and wants to get paid while he is doing it and not after he has reached the top.He is a draw at home or away.Most baseball fans hope the impasse will be resolved for it is they who will be rewarded. They want to see Vida do his thing.However, the way things are going it might be safer to bet on hell freezing over than Finley changing his mind.Photo (VIDA BLUE seeks a $50,000 raise.)","1972",0,0

McGovern.)The Nixon Administration has demonstrated not just benign neglect of the needs of the poor and the minorities. His has been a malignant rejection of the nation's commitment under the previous Democratic Administration to eradicate the economic and political repression undergirding American racism.In 1971, the chairman of the NAACP's national board, Bishop Spottswood, correctly branded President Nixon as the first anti-Black president the nation has had since Rutherford B. Hayes, who turned racial progress into racial repression.Nixon's still anti-Black and so much of his policy is racist.He has become the world's champion bomber by raining down more than a ton of explosives a minute on the non-white peoples of Indochina.Under his Administration, the conscription and deaths of Black men have far exceeded their numbers in the population, and these losses leave familes without their sons and brothers and rob our women and children of husbands and fathers.We saw unemployment rise to a 10-year high during Nixon's Presidency.And many of the people pushed on relief and into bread lines because of the Nixon-engineered joblessness are Blacks--the last hired and the first fired.In urban centers where Blacks reside, the unemployment rate has more than doubled the highest rate of unemployment experienced by all others.Nixon is guilty of causing the loss of jobs by our brothers and sisters and at the same time allowing prices to rise out of sight.Meanwhile, he has supported welfare . . . the rich corporation like Lockheed, has allowed big business to rake off huge windfall profits in the wage-price freeze and in wheat deals.The big trouble with this President and his anti-Black policies is that he tries to trick and fool voters by making big promises while vetoing child care programs, impounding millions in health care programs that would benefit ghetto residents and undermining education while calling for $2.5 billion in what he mislabels as compensatory education funds.The President talked a lot of law and order to get elected but allows his own operatives to break the law.","1972",0,1

They had viewed numbers of the persons who earn their existence from the great human desire to seek pleasure at whatever the pleasure seekers cost may be.There was also a young man who was later identified as Frank Hall Jr., who lives in another section of the city where pleasure buyers have a habit of congregating. Hall, of 141 Eddy St., had a commodity to sell for which pleasure-seeking men have paid varying prices ever since Bibical times.Totally unaware of the identity of the potential customers Hall made his pitch to the two plainclothesmen during which he inquired if the two men were seeking any action.The officers asked just what sort of action did Hall have in mind.Hall, according to the police answered, ""Girls, man, girls.""The two officers then answered if there were girls and if they looked all right, after a looksee they could be interested.Hall then informed the officers that he was so eager for their business, that he, Hall would drive them over to see the bewitching ladies in his own car, and asked the officers to meet him at the corner of Broadway and Kearney Sts.Hall soon appeared with his car and he spent the time driving to his rendezvous explaining to the potential customers the delights offered by his co-workers.When the car approached the intersection of Taylor and Eddy Sts., Hall pointed out a young lady who was walking the street and identified her to the officers as his candidate for all of the delights which sultans obtained in their harems.He also explained that the officers would have to give him $25. which he would give to the delightful creature and there was a service charge of five additional dollars which would go into the Hall exchequer.At this time the officers produced their badges to the surprised Hall, informing him that he was forthwith under arrest, charged with soliciting for an act of prostitution.Holdup men in most cases of armed robbery generally rely on either guns or some sharp object like a knife, dirk, razor or anything other than a stick which Dwayne Manuel, 25, of Pacifica used in a caper which occurred on Reardon Road, a street which is located in the Hunters Point area.Diana Monroe, 19, of 76 Woodrow Ave., Daly City, was enroute to visit a friend who lives at 34 Reardon Road, when Manuel made the big scene.Diana, according to police, was suddenly set upon by Manuel who was armed with a large piece of wood.Manuel made good use of the wood as he rained blows upon the head and shoulders of the lady, while attempting to grab her purse.The blows soon became more than what the lady could take, for she sought refuge at 76 Reardon Road from whence she called the police.Police described her mental state as being hysterical, her physical state showed all of the evidence as though she had been in combat.Police searched the area with the victim and soon found the suspect sitting in a car.The victim went to Mission Emergency Hospital for treatment. Manuel went to City Prison where he was charged with felonius assault and armed robbery.Yolanda Howard, 18, 1622 25th St., did not like what Danny Menifee, 23, was attempting to do in her home so she protested not only verbally but made some physical attempts at prevention.Menifee had a hypodermic needle in his hand and was attempting to inject some substance in his arm, police said.Yolanda's sudden onslaught upset Menifee to such an extent that he knocked her down and then proceeded to kick her in the stomach.Yolanda fled from the sanctuary of her home to the streets where her screaming attracted the attention of two police officersThd officers accompanied her back to her apartment where they confiscated a bag which contained paraphenalia which they believed is for narcotic uses and also confiscated Menifee, who was charged with suspicion of felonious assault and for possession of a hypodermic needle.","1972",0,0

Economics seems to be as unviersial as racism.Ruhinda stressed the blatant inaccuracy of ""Western"" press in the covering of African events. The issues of General Amin' Uganda and Tanzania was an example noted Ruhinda. ""There was no open war between the two countries...the issues involved Amin's followers and other Ugandians who supported the late Obote.""In response to the Asian exodus, Ruhinda said he's aware that there are to types of Asians in Uganda, one that seeks citizenship and the other with European leanings. ""Amin picked the Asian issue to become more popular with his countrymen.""One of Ruhinda's observations (although the State Department had both here to view the elections first hand) was the continuing shift apart of the races. ""I had no idea so many black Americans lived here"" he said. And while calling the level of awareness among the average African ""disturbingly low"" Ruhinda had some praise for the Black Political convention in Gary earlier this year. ""It's important for blacks to physically unit.""Ruhinda said the purpose of his paper, one of two papers funded by TANU, the national liberation organization, is to educate and organize the masses. Nine out of ten still live on the land in Tanzania, with more and more turning toward the governments ""Ujamma"" (Co-op) villages which provides schools, health services and running water.The editor said the main stumbling block preventing his progressive country from becoming industrialized are the world's super powers who dominate the world market. ""The peace corps were not getting anything solved"" but were used for political propaganda he added.Mr. Agun was also somewhat critical of ""Western"" press coverage of African news. ""There is a clear need for improvement...more investigation instead of what simply sells papers..(the violence).""Agun said the coverage of the Nigerian civil war read like a bloodbath with the three major tribes (Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba) at each others throat, ""This was not the case...those causing all the disturbance amounted to nothing more than a small group.""Agun said his paper with a 80,000 circulation includes much news of Africa and so does the Sunday Observer (180,000) which is read in all parts of Nigeria.The picture in Nigeria seems to be the final coming together of the three major groups and the 250 various dialects. Everyone is competing for civil service jobs on the state and national level and the selection is based on qualifications. ""There is no job discrimination in Nigeria"" he said with a confident grin.Agun said his country was in strong support of the cause of African freedom fighters and Nigeria as an active member of the Organization of African Um (OAU) has done much on the summit and other levels in terms of the struggle.""I place much of the blame not on Portugal but on her fellow allies in NATO"" said Agun ""they see what Portugal is doing yet they refuse to act in our favor.""The editor said he has not registered any observations about the U.S. as yet because he has not been here two weeks. He plans to travel the south extensively and talk to a great variety of black citizens.""What I have heard about the young blacks here is there willingness to take African studies...they need to see Nairobi Kenya, a beautiful city with fine buildings all owned by whites while blacks are shopkeepers."" ""We need trained engineers and scientists"" he said.""While we encourage black Americans to our country we also welcome industry and investment.""Most of the things Agun said were not greek, even his paper is printed in English, the national language of Nigeria.","1972",1,0

The Giants have the nucleus of a championship team right now.The team is blessed with two fine young potential superstars barring injury: Bobby Bonds and Dave Kingman. Willie McCovey, healthy is capable of at least two more banner years.Tito Fuentes and Chris Speier are very capable and exciting players to watch. Kenny Henderson is still trying to get it together, a trade might help unless he straightens up and hits hard.Sam McDowell and Juan Marichal are doing some fine pitching so far in the season. Juan is probably wondering whatever happened to Mr. Luck. He realizes that he can't depend on the fine gentleman for all of his wins, but please Sir, give him a little of your magic and I'm sure the team and the fans will still count on you too, Mr. Luck.Charlie Fox couldn't be more pleased with the development of Steve Stone and Ron Bryant. Steve and Juan Marichal are both pitching with ERA's under 3.00 and that's good, now only, if they could get some wins.Elliot Maddox and Bernie Williams are still learning how to play outfield on Candlestick's (shades of Mays) windy turf. A year should get them ready, because they both can hit, and that's the name of the game, (almost).Dave Rader and Fran Healy are adequate catchers who can only improve on their performance. Alan Gallagher probably wants to be traded, now that the lanky strongman Kingman knows his way around third base. He's not Brook Robinson yet, but give him time. At least with his height and speed he will spear plenty high line drives that no other third baseman will attempt to reach.So, with all of this potential greatness, learning how to pitch, hit curve balls, play the outfield, and catch how can the Bay Bombers miss next year, remember you read is first in SPORTS RAP.One of the finest athletes to grace Sacramento will graduate this year from Cordova High School, Jerry Manvel.This young, gifted and small -- 5'6"", 150 pounds -- dynamite has led Gordova to two championships this year. Jerry led Cordova's football team to title in their division, and scored three touchdowns in their victory over Grant in the playoffs.He was named to the nation's All-America High School Football team.

The rule was changed in 1962 because of coaches' attitudes in red shirting athletes.The revelation was a cruel blow to Coach Jerry Waugh and his athletes but it appears nothing can be done about it.Of course, S.F. State president, S.I. Hayakawa, said he is going to challenge the NCAA. But his efforts seem futile.The team can still be proud of its 18-7 record for the past season, the best record of any Gator team in 17 years.

That is quite an accomplishment and no NCAA ruling can take that away from them.In fact, since Waugh became head coach at the Lake Merced school the squad has won 34 games while losing 19.The strangest part of the ruling is that the man under investigation played for S.F.

They happily understood every word and nuance of the Negro spirituals and psalms that closed the two-plus hour program including a generous round of encores.AMONG SPONSORS of the concert were POST Publisher and Mrs. Tom Berkley who welcomed into their box Dr. and Mrs. Marvin Poston of Danville (he recently named Optometrist or the Year); Mr. and Mrs. Ed Perea of Hayward (he's a Sears executive); POST Associate Editor Bill Smallwood and Warren Gordon, newly appointed Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator at the Oakland Naval Supply Center. Bill and Warren brought out of town friends on from the pre-concert dinner William Duncan Allen, director of the East Bay Music Center, hosted for 20 at his San Francisco apartment, and sipped cocktails in the Opera House lounge before joining the Berkley box.Incidentally, Bill Allen's weekend houseguests for the concert were Dr. Anne Cooke Reid, a faculty member at UC-Santa Cruz who is resigning to accept a post in the East, and Bob Gray of Los Angeles. Other concert fans from down south included the Allen C. Woodards III, seated in Hugh and Connie Beaty's box--she was chairman of the music center ticket committee--and Josephine Cooper who was a houseguest of Dr. Lindley Mordecai for the big event.OTHERS SPOTTED in the packed house were Harriet and Arthur Eaton of El Cerrito; Col. Josephine Lydon of San Francisco; the John Norfords of Berkeley; Billie Miller of El Cerrito and her sister, Mary Cobb, the Oakland soprano; Maugerite Roles of Berkeley and Jordon Wright and daughter, Sherrie, both of Oakland.The Reverend Hazaiah Williams Berkeley music patron and member of that city's board of education, hosted guests in several boxes.Adjoining boxes had been taken by Dr. and Mrs. James L. Hutchinson of Atherton, whose names were among the long list of patrons of the concert, as were so many other supporters.INNUMERABLE FOLK strolled to the nearby San Francisco Negro Historical and Cultural Society building on McAllister Street for a gala after-concert reception for Miss Price, hosted by the East Bay Music Center.The statue . . ., who rose from deep . . .

"356","Berkley, Gail",1972-09-21,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Aileen C. Hernandez, chairone of the National Advisory Committee and former national president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), is unique in the Women's Liberation movement. She is one of few Black women nationally prominent in the women's movement.In the San Francisco office of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing (NCDH), for which she is Western representative and consultant, Ms. Herndez--still fresh at the end of her working day--discussed her feelings about the women's movement and other activities in her busy life.""The main concerns of NOW--child care, equal rights for women, the ability to control one's body and the right to reach your full potential--are common to all women,"" she said.Ms. Hernandez pointed out that a recent Harris poll found that--in fact--Black women have the highest level of acceptance of these issues of any women in the country.""The hesitancy of Black women to become involved in the womens movement, however, is largely due to what they have seen in the press.""Rather than focusing on the issues the media tend to mislead the public into believing that the movement is anti-male and frivolous or that it is run by women who covet test tube babies, she said. In addition, since the movement was founded by white women, ""Black women are reluctant to participate. It is difficult for Black women to believe that there are non-racist reasons for the movement.""Actually, Ms. Hernandez contended, NOW is part of the revolution for social justice for all people, and recognizes the link between women and other disadvantaged groups who suffer injustice.""For example, when Angela Davis was on trial the national board of directors of NOW issued a statement calling on the courts to guarantee her a fair and just trial. Surprisingly, this action was recommended by the Atlanta chapter and written by the Houston chapter.""NOW chapters also work closely with the National Welfare Rights Organization, she said. ""The great majority of people on welfare are women. Economic wealth for women would help solve the welfare problem.""If more white men were out of work, the government would probably come up with a better substitute for welfare,"" she said.Ms. Hernandez feels it is ""doubly important"" for Black women to be involved in the movement for human rights for all. If a woman is discriminated against both as a Black person and a woman this hurts the entire Black family, she said, since more Black women than white work but ""are on the bottom of the economic totem pole,"" as far as salaries go.Furthermore, she argued. The Black liberation movement should work with the women's movement. ""If we can ever get all women to realize how much they are linked to other disadvantaged groups we can get major change, because women are a majority in this country.""Some Black women have expressed the opinion that now is a time for them to step back while their men take the lead. But Ms. Hernandez feels that if ""Black women step back this is only an illusion of progress. We should stand alongside our men and do something for the community.""She said Black women can actually be a rising force in the movement for equality for all people because, ""they aren't as hung up as white women about whether to stay home. Since historically this choice has not been theirs, they are ahead in the concept of being fully involved.""Since it has been necessary for both partners to work to support their families in a racist economic climate, ""Black men are ahead of white men, because they are used to working with women in egalitarian situations,"" Ms. Hernandez continued, whereas white men often expect their women to be subservient.""The Black family may be a good focus of strength rather than something to be destroyed. Someone should point out the strengths of what Black men and women are doing in working together,"" she said. ""Both, Black men and women should take advantage of this experience and move into leadership roles in the movement.""While on the subject of the family Ms. Hernander thought men should have more involvement in raising children. ""Too many children get smothered by a mother who has no other interests. It might be more healthy for children and parents if both parents shared child rearing.""If husband and wife shared equally work and child rearing negative sex stereotyping which exist today might also be broken down, she said. Too often the father is not around and is seen by the children only as a disciplinarian, and at birth boys and girls are immediately programed into pre-determined sex roles.Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Ms. Hernandez credits her mother and a ""great advisor in high school"" with being instrumental in helping her decide that she wanted to do something meaningful with her live.Once this decision was made and she was out in the world of work, Ms. Hernandez recalled how she ran into problems with racism and sexism. For example, she had been assistant educational director of the Pacific Coast region of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union for 10 years when the director left. There was a nationwide search for a replacement before those in authority recognized that Ms. Hernandez was the logical predecessor to her former boss.She served as director for less than a year and then left the Los Angeles post to work where she felt her talents would be more appreciated.After serving as Campaign Coordinator for Alan Cranston in his successful bid for relection to the State Controller's office in 1962, Ms. Hernandez was chief of the California division of Fair Employment Practices. She left this post when she was appointed to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in May, 1965 by former President Lyndon Johnson.But Ms. Hernandez resigned from the Commission because she felt her work had no meaning.""Working for the government one is confined to working or commenting only on what those in charge feel is important.""Ms. Hernandez is presently self-employed as a consultant and lecturer on such urban problems as employment, housing, sex discrimination and racism. She finds self employment satisfying because she has the freedom to speak out on issues that concern her. Some of her clients have included the University of California, Contra Costa County, Pacific Telephone, Standard Oil of California and the Richmond Redevelopment Agency.Not surprisingly, Ms. Hernandez said that the most fulfilling thing that she does is ""working with people--especially young people.""","1972",1,0

As part of its annual luncheon at His Lordship's Restaurant on the Berkeley Marina, Mrs. Dorothy Pitts, president, took nearly thirty minutes in her presentation of the gold-bronzed plaque as she went through the long credits to Mrs. Williams in the fashion world.Mrs. Williams is a member of the Models Association of America, in New York, and prime mover in the organization of the SHADES OF BLACK three years ago.Bettye now runs the only school directed toward the graduate fashion model: the Bettye Williams Finishing School for Black Models. Only a select few may attend because of limited facilities at this time. Says Bettye, ""Our society is serving as an example of what a Black professional model should be."" And they set a high standard, as anyone who's seen them can testify. ""At the present time, it is impossible to take every model upon her graduation into our Society in order to give them exposure,"" she continued. ""We try, but unfortunately we're not a model agency.""In 1973, Bettye Williams is doing something about that. She is opening her own agency for models as well as artists, primarily those who are actors and actresses. So the Bay Area will be seeing more activities directed at focusing public attention on Black models and actors.To aid in promoting fashion industry careers, the SHADES OF BLACK have organized their scholarship fund.

"359","",1972-02-03,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","It's the truth Motown has discovered and recorded two women and a man who can each deliver a soulful solo or get together and sing sweet and close like they invented three-part harmony. That's the truth - The Undisputed Truth. You can discover the ""Truth"" for yourself on this exciting new trio's debut album, ""The Undisputed Truth,"" on Motown's Gordy label.""Save My Love For A Rainy Day"" introduced to pop fans the new sound of The Undisputed Truth - Billie Rae Calvin, Brenda Joyce Evans and Joe Harris - and paved the way for its runaway hit single, ""Smiling Faces Sometimes,"" written and produced by Norman Whitfield, the country's leading hit record producer and the group's personal manager.Both these single smashes are included in the album, ""The Undisputed Truth,"" together with the trio's very personal interpretations of some familiar Motown hits and a wealth of fresh material written by Norman Whitfield especially for the ""Truth.""The group's smash hit tradition is bound to be preserved with ""You Make Your Own Heaven And Hell Right Here On Earth,"" a single now being sold. And the ""Truth's second album offering, titled ""Face To Face With The Truth,"" has No. 1 written all over it.Billie Rae Calvin and Brenda Joyce Evans, the distaff members of The Undisputed Truth, were born and raised on the west side of Los Angeles. But it wasn't until their almost parallel musical development was nearly complete that these two talented women's professional association began.It was while attending Los Angeles City College, singing background for a local record company, that Brenda's and Bille's professional association began. Brenda was a member of ""The Delicates,"" a female trio, and Billie was singing with ""The Cool Sounds,"" a mixed vocal group. With similar backgrounds and a mutual professional respect to draw them together, Billie and Brenda became fast friends.Through Motown producer Frank Wilson, the girls began adding their own sweet harmony to records by The Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, The Marvelettes, Jimmy Ruffin and The Supremes, making a tremendous impression on everyone at Motown, including Norman Whitfield.Norman's interest was significant; an idea for a new group and a new sound had germinated in a corner of his mind, and this female group suddenly gave his idea substance. Norman's dream would soon manifest itself in musical reality, yet he knew instinctively he must add one more ingredient to achieve the sound that echoed in his imagination. Whitfield added Joe Harris.Joe Harris, the male third of the ""Truth,"" was born in Detroit and grew up in the same musical atmosphere of urban soul that nurtured so many Motown stars. Joe graduated from Martha Reeves' alma mater, Northeastern High School, where The Supremes' Mary Wilson was one of his classmates.Throughout high school, Joe was actively involved in every phase of music, playing saxophone in the band, singing in the glee club and even being elected president of the school choir in his senior year. But Joe's interest in music never kept from excelling in other areas.An outstanding second baseman on Northeastern's championship baseball team, Joe broke the city record for stolen bases in his senior year and won himself not one but two offers of athletic scholarships. It was one of these scholarships that enabled Joe to attend Wayne State University in Dotroit where he, of course, studied music.Before long, Joe found himself singing in a group with two other fellows to earn money for school expenses. As the group's bookings grew more lucrative and more demanding, Joe found himself struggling to keep up with his studies while also trying to hold up his end so the group could take advantage of the offers.When the group was offered a recording contract with a local record company, Joe decided to accept the offer. He discontinued his studies at Wayne to concentrate on a music career.When Joe returned to Detroit to sing solo on the Motor City's talent - laden night club circuit, he didn't escape the attention of Motown for long. Norman Whitfield approached Joe and explained his plans for a unique new group. Joe was convinced, and Norman added the final ingredient to the new sound of his new group: The Undisputed Truth.With so much in common, both in their musical backgrounds and their zeal to realize their full potential under the masterful guidance of Norman Whitfield, Bille Rae Calvin, Brenda Joyce Evans and Joe Harris established an instant rapport that has since fused these three individual talents into one perfectly harmonious vocal instrument.That's the truth - The Undisputed Truth!","1972",0,0

Shaw, Civic Arts Foundation, 2333 Shattuck Avenue. Berkeley CA 94701. Checks should be made payable to the Civic Arts Foundation-Romare Bearden Project.IDEAThe initial idea for a major mural by Bearden came from Peter Selz, director of University of California Art Museum. Selz and Worth discussed the possibility with Raymond Saunders, anothe major Black artist who teaches at California State College at Hayward and who made contact with the New York-based artist.In correspondence, Worth suggested to Bearden that a mural would have significance to the Berkeley community as a ""unifying humanistic vision of the city; as a major cultural asset and as a first step in a process of publiclys upported art projects.""Worth Said Bearden's work highly stylized collage-paintings of Black life both Southern and Northern -- represented ""a man of intense vision.""The Civic Art Commission selected Bearden because his work is a rare combination of a highly developed aesthetic structure and a readily comprehensible subject matter.Bearden uses real elements but puts them together in a highly poetical and subjective way, said Worth.NATIVEBorn in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 2, 1914, Bearden was raised in New York City, He graduated from Peabody, High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and from New York University in 1935.Originally intending a mathematics career, Bearden became interested in cartooning while in college and gradually developed a life-long commitment to art. Art critics say his work has been influenced--over a 35-year period--by European, African and American art styles. His paiting progressed from early representational to abstract and he began to create collages in the 1960s stressing rural and urban life as he has known it.The mural of Berkeley and its people that Bearden ultimately creates will surely incite a high degree of interest and excitement among all observers.'ARTIFICE'Bearden himself reminds viewers that ""Art, it must be remembered, is artifice, or a creative undertaking, the primary function of which is to add to our existing conception of reality.""Photo (DREARY - Drab decor of Berkeley City Hall Council Chambers, is due for refurbishing with major rejuvenation expected to be Romare Bearden mural replacing panoramic photo that now serves as backdrop during Council deliberations.

"363","",1973-02-10,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)"," March 15 is a crucial day in San Francisco for followers of the political game.This is the deadline to collect 70,000 petition signatures to force a special June election which would change the city's method of electing supervisors.According to coordinator Calvin Welch, 4500 circulators are attempting to gather the necessary 70,000 registered voters If successful, the city's electorate will vote on whether it wants 11 supervisorial districts. Currently, the supervisors are elected on at large basis.Last year the supervisors rejected putting the measure on the November ballot. Their eloquent debate on an August Monday after noon did little to cover the real reasons for not going to the voters with this proposal.Several supervisors would lose their jobs.Five of the city's 11 elected legislators currently live in District 8 (shown on the map). This area includes the affluent St. Francis Woods neighborhood, which indicates the kind of money needed to run for supervisor on a large basis.Supporters of the district plan claim to represent all neighborhoods of the city. Today's supervisors were elected with substantial backing from what is euphemistically referred to as the 'downtown interests.'A chart prepared by supporters of the district measure analyzed the prohibitive costs of running for supervisor. In 1971 Ron Pelosi spent $86,500; Bob Mendelsohn, $99,370; Bob Gonzales, $54,000; Terry Francois, $67,600, John Molinari; $63,500 and Quentin Kopp, $45,400. These were six winners out of a field of 30 plus candidates.Supporters of the district elections claims if district elections are held the Supervisors will become a powerful body. Welch said the Supervisors control the entire city budget, make laws and ordinances. Welch says the current board is subservient to a strong Mayor Alioto and follow his lead. This sort of lackeyism has infected the public which cares little for its city legislators.The 11 supervisorial districts would undoubtedly find more minority people at City Hall. Hunters Point, Western Addition, Chinatown and Mission would have supervisorial districts.If the measure qualifies for the ballot a substantial fight by the monied interests can be expected. With the current Board of Supervisors, and their bank rollers, understandably opposed to district elections, the proponents of change face a rough future.Map","1973",1,0

The increase would raise costs to beneficiaries from $72 to $84, more than twice the $40 expected of medicare recipients in 1966.CLC says it approved the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's request for the increase based on a desire to involve the health service consumer in the economic decision to use hospital resources.Whitehurst says this reasoning is illogical.""In effect, the Council is telling medicare people that their use of hospitals is an economic and not a medical decision,"" Whitehurst explained. ""Such reasoning is based on a faulty assumption. It is the physician, and not the patient, who prescribes hospitalization.""The Virginia Congressman also disagrees with the administrations' opinion that the increase would encourage ""conscious behavior"" in the health system.

It was the almost ""private"" beach adjoining the home of a wonderful Hawaiian family, the Amil Valpoons, living in the island of Kauai. Prior to the swim I had awakened from a short siesta in their living room to soft Hawaiian music from a long-playing tape which one of the daughters had put on their stereo playing system. And following the swim, in which my companions were Amil himself and his three and a half year old granddaughter Carla, a veritable little porpoise in the water, we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks on the porch with various relatives and neighbors who dropped by.The residence of the Valpons had once belonged to an aunt of San Francisco's Katherine Flippin who had gone to Hwaii early in the century to teach, later becoming an outsanding educator, principal of the local school and greatly revered by the native population. Thus my gratitude to my childhood friend, Kay Flippin, for providing me the introduction.The next morning I was given a tour through the western portion of this island, known as the Garden Isle, and on our way to the North Shore Beach of Princeville, off the Hanalei Bay, we passed the 300 acre Papaya Farm owned by the Valpoons, where father, son, other relatives and friends are employed.It is always good when an American has the opportunity of visiting in homes of various nationals when traveling in any part of the world. Whereas my brother and I had stayed in famed old Hotel Royal Hawaiian in Honolulu, and in the sparking new and interesting Waiakea Village Resort in Hilo, we were entertained by friends in their lovely homes. Colonel and Mrs. James Keenan and their charming daughters in Honolulu, he the soon to retire Chief Surgeon of the Army Hospital, and introduced to me on a previous visit by my friend, Colonel Josphine Lydon of San Francisco, retired army dietitian of the local Presidio. In Hilo, it was in the home of realtor Helene Hale and her son, William, the visit coinciding there with the piano recital of a talented young miss, a friend of the Hales. From there I drove to Kona, a hundred miles distant on the other side of the big isle the Orchid Isle, with Will Hale to his charming oceanside home on a ten-acre site of coffee and macadamia trees. Will finds little time to care for them, being the busy teacher of English in the local high school.

There were probably a lot of basketball buffs who, after reading the Sunday morning sports pages, wished very dearly they had seen last Saturday night's game.For you hundreds who missed the classic affair, the Warriors played up to their fighting name as they welcomed the official return and debut of former teammate, Rick Barry. The Warriors played before a screaming and estatic crowd of 8,173 who, as it turned out, had more than enough to cheer about as the Warriors played the starring role from the beginning whistle down to the final seconds.If you missed it, that's too bad; but I don't think anyone at the Coliseum missed you. The crowd of slightly over 8,000 could easily have been mistaken for a packed arena.Both teams were late taking the floor and rumors began to circulate ""maybe they won't show up and the Bucks will win by default."" Somebody suggested that the Warriors were probably somewhere out back playing ""hunch"" to try to hit the floor hot and have an edge on the Bucks. Which could have been true, as a more hot footed reeved-up bunch of guys have not been witnessed in Warrior uniform this season. I'm sure it made a much pleasant ride back East facing a best-two-out-of-three situation instead of a must win to stay alive.The Warriors were doing it on the floor while all the officials in the stands kept the two officials on the floor on their toes. Their insistance on absolute, unquestionable calls was somewhat understandable, let's fact it; they have sat through some pretty dismal performances.It was a little disappointing, however, to not see the dapper Warrior coach, Alvin Attles, thrown out of the game. His demeanor almost matched his attire, as the modishly dressed director actually kept to his seat throughout most of the game. The only hint of nervousness being visible by the piece of paper he folded and unfolded and twisted into a million different shapes throughout the game. Just as he'd get it all . . ., he'd smooth it out and start twisting and folding it again. As a matter of fact, I don't think he got up but twice during the game to scream at the refs - is that super cool, or is it?but, back to the quintet on the floor, while forward Rick Barry was fulfilling everyone's hope that he would return to his former Warrior playing days form, everybody else on the team was putting if together like a finely tuned watch.Instinctively I seem to focus on individuals who, for one reason or another appear to be underdogs. And with all those towering giants running around on the floor, it's not too difficult to pick out a guy who is only 6 foot. However, after you watch Charles Johnson play a few minutes, you find out that he matches up pretty evenly to the tallest ones. He is a strong ball handler and shows his ability to control the action on the court.Saturday night, in seventeen minutes of play, he made three out of five field goals attempted, got three rebounds, two assists and totalled seven points.But the real star, the unsung hero, the backbone of the Warriors, Nate Thurmond, was his usual great self. What can you say about a guy who plays a consistently good game. He's so good all the great phrases become worn. Maybe the team and the fans start taking him for granted because he is always there and always good.Without Nate there just isn't a Warrior team. Perhaps that is the reason why Owner Franklin Mieuli has been able to hold onto his dream of a championship team all these years despite the many problems he has had. With Nate as the backbone it's not difficult to dream of a championship team.Nate's been playing a long time and recently indicated that he would probably play only a couple more years before retiring. It's almost impossible to visualize the Warriors without one of the finest centers in the NBA. But as professional sports is only a sport to the fans, the business of basketball, like any profession is wearing, and eventually all executives look forward to retirement and other interests.Retirement for Nate will undoubtedly mean devoting more time to developing and running his recently opened restaurant, ""The Beginning"" on Fillmore Street in The City.""The Beginning"" sounds as if there is more to come and perhaps one day we'll just read about the famous restauranteur Nate Thurmond, who was once the greatest center in the NBA.","1973",0,0

GOD's HOUSE IN RUINS, (vv. 1-6).Haggai dates precisely the beginning of his prophetic ministry. He repeatedly urged the leaders of Judah and the people to bend their energies to the rebuilding of the ruined Temple.Haggai, like other prophets did not need to create a sense of wrongdoing, but only to awaken conscience. He challenged their idle excuses. (The time is not come) Evidently this was no sincere desire to await some specified date, but a willful delaying of duty. So he asked this question, viz: Is it time for you to live in your celled houses, and let My house go to waste!Houses panelled with costly cedar planks; they could seem to afford luxuries for themselves but were indifferent to the ruined state of the Temple. But, ""Consider your ways! i.e. Consider thoughtfully the situation in which you find yourselves. If you fail to heed v.5, consider v.6 which indicates that their labour had been ill rewarded.II. A CHALLENGE TO REBUILD (vv. 7,8).Haggai confronted the people with the imperative of a word from the Lord of Hosts. They needed to take stock of their situation, primarily their stewardship before the Lord and their dependence on Him for both security and prosperity. They had experienced failures of crops, continuous poverty. and lessening of physical vigour. (Bags with holes in them) No one seems to get ahead, but rather seems to lose his money as fast as he accumulates it. The prophet was in earnest, if you want a blessing from the Lord, ""Go up to the mountain, (Bring wood) i.e. timber suitable for building the Temple of Jehovah which had been lying in ruins since being destroyed at the command of Nebuchadrezzar (2 King 25:9). ""And I will be glorified.""III. RESPONSE OF THE PEOPLE (vv. 12-15).Both Zerubbabel and Joshua demonstrated their fitness for spiritual leadership by willing response, and all the people followed their example in obedience to the word of God through Haggai. The leaders and the people. their consciences awakened, encouraged by Haggai begin work upon the Temple (September, 520 B.C.)","1973",0,0

So much so that I have to keep at work-outs at the Y.M.C.A. and can make it.""""Looking at iron-jawed, muscular John Dorsey, one wonders when in his peripatetic life he ever would actually be pooped out A combination of terrific drive plus boundless energy, he is expert at moving whole slews of airborne people from here to there and to and fro. A five-year employee at TWA, he recently was appointed Manager in Special Market Sales after having filled the position of Sales Representative via the firm's San Francisco office.When he first joined the company -- getting his feet good and wet, he described . . . his specialized duties were gradually extended after awhile. He was responsible for selling TWA to various groups of Blacks throughout the bay area, accent mainly on the N.A.A.C.P., Urban League, church organizations and fraternal groups. In time, this broadened to include numerous individual luminaries. Such newsworthy mile-coverers as Aretha Franklin, Sammy Davis, the Chambers Brothers, Sly & Family Stone, Dells, Delfonics.""Most of them are fun to work with and for,"" he observes. ""Oh, I'd say a few could be sourpusses once in a great while, but some high-strung performers come in that category. It can be a tough way to make a living. I can sense when they want to just sleep and when they're moody.""Occasionally, he gets hi-there messages from some of his charges, all over the globe, Members of the rock group, Tuna, continue to reasure association with Dorsey and see to it that he knows how they are doing. He evidently made happy the national touring company of David Merrick's Promises, Promises, when he moved them out of San Francisco to their next destination. As he also did the original company of No Place To Be Somebody after the local engagement ended and they were due in Chicato.He has some top favorites, of course. Like Quicksilver Messenger Service, Cold Blood, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and Dave Mason Band. His eyes twinkle speculatively when asked why: ""They travel often and far and fast!"" And, one is prone to think, at first class prices, no doubt.But it isn't difficult to realize that John Dorsey's feelings are very special when he refers to professional athletes in terms as clients. His face then becomes even more expressive. A former athlete himself, he identifies with that variegated cross-section. In handling transportation for the Oakland Athletics ball team (the famous mule, Charlie O., has also flown under the Dorsey aegis), he has become good friends with Blue Moon Odom -- ""warm and down to earth"" -- and Vida Blue, whom he admires greatly. Three planes usually are put into service to transport a ball team, such a gigantic operation calling for perfect timing all down the line. Plus seeing to it that such high-salaried performers are kept as happy as possible and as long as possible. The prima donnas among them, above all.The San Francisco Giants sing John Dorsey and TWA's praises, not being ones to permit more fervent hosannahs to come from Oakland, by no means. His favorite team member? Willie McCovey. Then Tito Puentes. He recalled the time when he brought the players home from Cincinati after one of their more depressing seasons. ""Some of us started harmonizing and dancing in the aisles. Soon the whole plane was having a ball with us. Coach passengers broke out with applause when we finally collapsed in our seats. It was a gas of a trip."" Dorsey, proficient a detail man, works out fine points such as decorating the interior of planeswith balloons and personalized banners when his two teams are victoriously jetting places. He even masterminded a birthday cake for Reggie Jackson, lit candles everywhere signifying Reggie's number of home runs. On his flight list are the San Francisco Warriors. He looks upon manager Al Attles as truly a beautiful brother who sees to it that he gets as much business as possible because he realizes only too well just what a constant tough struggle it is for a Black to make it in this coldly competitive world.Each summer the Warriors conduct basketball free throw clinics. During a major session, Dorsey correlated the prize-winning elimination contest for them and produced a corps of cute stewardesses to keep score. Part of his reflections about his fascinating career is his regard for Joe Frazier, who gave Dorsey a pleasant surprise by proving to be three or four different persons all in one. ""He's a deep man, inside. He startled me several times as we exchanged philosophies."" Dorsey commented.Africa stirs John Dorsey tremendously. Black travel, of course, remains a top priority of his. To date, he's seen 20 groups visit the continent. On four occasions he went along. His wife, Bertha, an Oakland school teacher, and son, Rodney, and daughter, Jocelyn, share his intensity for Africa and hope to visit it again, soon. Talking about the historic area, he stresses his aims to locally develop greater travel interest there. He feels tourism should be projected into African countries rather than the usual European gambits. He thinks the time is way overdue for us to let our money filter down to emerging Third World countries. ""Black Americans should be more aware of all the great physical beauty and culture throughout Africa,"" he emphasizes. He's steadfast when he declared Hawaii can't hold a candle to Africa for out and out beauty, miles of unspoiled beaches and numerous resort areas. Each time he returns home from visits to Africa, he's loaded down like a collector with art objects, cloth, sculpture and musical instruments.Dorsey played football as a speedy half-back at Wiley College in Texas and at UCB. Injuries ended his promising career as a pro. He enjoys tutoring teenagers and sharing informal rap sessions with them. When he encounters any who may have keen interest in his profession at TWA, he stresses to them how important are studies in Business Administration, as a starter.A devotee of the theatre (he once toyed with idea of becoming an apprentice student at ACT), busy Dorsey finds time somehow to still dance up a storm and keep abreast with all the latest sounds. With excellent clothes taste, he dresses impeccably and is blessed with a really good tailor. Scotch is his drink and veal scallopini heads his list of favorite food. Instant was his infectious laugh when he recalled the time he and his wife were in Italy, of all places, and couldn't eat that delicious Italian dish because both had picked up badly inflamed strep throats while in Africa. ""All we could do was barely make it on our plane heading for home, But, dig that. Being in Rome where the best damn veal scallopini is and not being able to even look at any!""Up, up and away. That should be John Dorsey's theme music, for sure. Enviably so, as far as the rest of ud dull landlubbers are concerned.Photo (John Dorsey)","1973",0,0

Bates, age 19, who were stationed at Fort Ord California Army base have asked the Gay Alliance for assistance in exposing the racism and sexual exploitation within the WACS.Gail Bates, claims that as a black woman she has experienced oppression on three fronts, that of a Black person, being a woman and being Gay.Valerie and Gail explained at a recent news conference that the kinds of conditions within the WACS forced them into a homosexual relationship. The two women cited some of the rules and regulations enforced by the WACS which were repressive. No visits from men for 8 weeks and a rule which stated that all hair must not exceed over the collar were regulations cited by the two which helped lead them into their present situation.""No boys for eight weeks; what are you supposed to do, just sit around and twiddle your thumbs?"" Gail said.The two women maintain that they were not homosexual prior to entering the Army eight months ago, but they did enter the service at the same time and became close friends. ""I found that I could go to Valerie and talk about problems and things,"" Gail said.""There's nothing unusual about the homosexuality in the WACS, all you have to do is to look at the Sergeants,"" Valerie explained.Gail told members of the press that she and Valerie were given a warning against fraternizing by a white lesbian sergeant. (Fraternizing in the WACS has been described as being overly friendly with each other). The two women explained that they could not understand the warning or the sergeant's behavior. ""Most of the officers are white and lesbians. ""Mixed couples, like me and Gail are frowned upon,"" Valerie said. ""Gail presented a threat by being black and the male figure in our relationship."" ""The Sergeant who gave us the warning really wanted me to be hers,"" Valerie said.Gail and Valerie denounce the racist tactics of the Womens Army Corps and the sexual oppressive and exploitative trips of commanding officers who use their rank to try and gain sexual favors.Both women have been threatened by the Army with long term imprisonment. They face being stockaded and a general court martial for homosexuality and they may end up serving 20 years with a dishonorable discharge.According to Ray Broshears, Chairperson for the S.F. Gay Alliance, this is the first time in San Franciscohistory that anyone from the military has stood up and told about the homosexuality within the military.The two women who were married two weeks ago in San Francisco in a traditional Gay celebration, see this as a beginning of a movement to liberalize the WACS.

"376","",1973-01-13,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The days intervening these memorable dates will undoubtedly go down in Black history as the most troubled and mysterious in these times. Following King's murder, Blacks reacted swiftly-setting the nation aflame with their anger and frustration.During the interim period, few asked why the King was destroyed. This was, after all, the United States of America-the country whose very history was comprised of the savage oppression of Blacks.It had become so apparent that the man shot down that day in Memphis was not the same rustic country preacher that first came to national attention with the Montgomery boycott.He had grown in political sophisticiation-understanding that moral appeal to a people without conscience was futile. King knew further than that the bonds that constrained Blacks and others were economic, as well as racial. He came to understand that the poison of American racism and capitalism had spread throughout the world-that the struggle was international in scope. No wonder that this Black man was cut down.The question that stirred in the minds of most Blacks was HOW had this dastardly crime been committed? As the bare facts were slowly revealed to the public, the questions multiplied:Ray, alias Eric Starvo Galt, alias Ramon George Sneyd, was a recent escapee from the Missouri State Penitiary. Months before the killing, he had painstakingly established the false identity of Eric Starvo Galt. He spent considerable sums of cash money on a new car, bartending and dancing lessons, trips to Mexico and New Orleans, although at the time he was unemployed.Ray shot King from the window of a rooming house across the street from the Lorraine Motel. Dr. King had housed himself previously in the white-operated Rivermont Motel, but he moved into the Negro-operated Lorraine on the day he was slain.In the 65 days that followed the assassination, Ray somehow alluded capture-zigzagging the world on a mad route from Atlanta-Canada-England-Portugal-England. His arrest in London was followed by drawn out extradiction proceedings. On July 19, he was finally returned to the U.S. to face muder charges in Tennessee. Delays plagued the trial once again, with Ray switching lawyers mid-stream to prevent any speedy dispensation of justice.On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced to 99 years with eligibility for parole in 30 years. The long awaited trial lasted a brief 1 1/2 hours, with only procedural testimony that revealed none of the details behind Ray's misadventure.On route to prison, Ray began having second thoughts about his guilty plea. He initiated a series of motions for a retrial on the basis that he had been coerced to plead guilty. The latest of the retrial motions was Dec 5.Following the conclusion of Ray's trial, Coretta King, the slain leader's widow, was quoted as saying, ""This plea of guilty cannot be allowed to close the case, to end the search for the many fingers which helped pull the trigger.""From all apparent evidence, the case is closed, the search ended. The facts surrounding King's death remain ever more clouded as few attempt to search out the truth. How long will the Black community tolerate these unanswered questions?Across the country, Blacks will commemorate January 15, the birthdate of Dr. Martin Luther King. Efforts might be better spent in a re-examination of the mysterious circumstances that surrounded his untimely death.Photo (Case file: Ray as 'Galt,' 1968 ...)","1973",0,1

The two pianos are ""prepared with a variety of rubber strips screws bolts, nuts and coms at precisely indicated positions under the strings.While the music is notated in the conventional way the resulting pitches and timbres are completely transformed, suggesting such varied tone colors and thythmic influences as Balinese, Caribbean and Tahaitian ethnic music as well as jazz and post serialism.Mathematically reasoned rhythmic complixities impose great technical demands on the performers.Four Organs (1970) by the young New York-based experimental composer Steve Reich, is a later development from his interest in phase-gate shift techniques, providing gradual metamorphosis of a given musical element into ever-richer complexity.For its Angel recording--as in the Ojai Festival performance--Thomas and Grierson were joined by the composer and the pop-jazz composer-pianist Roger Kellaway at four Farfisa organs, as used by many rock groups.To a steady rhythm of maracas (played by Tom Raney) strictly notated chords fluctuate in attack and release with ad lib repetition at the discretion of the leader (Thomas). The sonic impact, especially in the planned SQ quadraphonic release, is overwhelming.Thomas performances of this work last season in Boston and New York were newsworthy, controversial events.On the day following the last recording season.

"387","Stark, Fortney (Pete)",1973-04-18,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","My mail over the last couple of weeks indicates that people in the 8th Congressional District are fed up with rising food costs. Two letters in particular illustrate the food dilemma facing low and middle-income families today.A San Leandro housewife, who characterized herself as ""home economist for a nonprofit organization,"" wrote.""My husband grossed $10,500 last year. We are a family of five. I don't mind that we show no profit...but I do not feel it is right to control part of the economy and not the rest. I have had the same food budget for three years. I spent $20 a week for food...and at the beginning, I played a game at the market...getting as much value as possible for money. Now it is no game.""A Dublin couple wrote:""Inflationary food prices affect our family more than anything. We have six children and we all developed a bad habit early in life of eating. We consider ourselves as being among the middle class, not poor, however our status is slowly moving toward the latter. If subsidies are to be given to farmers, why not use them as incentives to produce and get the prices down, especially in the areas of raw farm products. We can do without a new color TV or auto but food we feel is something Congress should pursue with aggressiveness.""There are indications Congress will try to ease the price squeeze, although I must admit I am already frustrated by the unspirited manner in which this body operates. The House Banking and Currency Committee, which I am a member of, has begun public hearings on extension of the pricewage control law. Our chairman, Representative Wright Patman, told the President that Congress will try to add ""strengthening amendments"" to present law. Conceivably, this could mean food price controls.There are certain areas of the food price problem that I will suggest exploring. Everyone seems to be blaming everyone and everything else for what is happening. Secretary of Agriculture Butz blames labor's pursuit of higher wages Economists cite vicious competition in the food industry, increased profit margins of supermarkets, bad weather--which ruined food and feed crops--and last summer's Russin wheat deal which sent the price of wheat and feed grains soaring.Some of my colleagues believe the most important factor behind rising food costs is the Administration's ""politically motivated"" policy of driving farm prices up during an election year.One of the most intriguing reasons was advanced by a Bay Area supermarket executive I consulted. He said a big reason California meat prices are soaring is because wealthy speculators invest in cattle and keep them off the market to force prices up. He said thousands of cattle are being held in San Joaquin Valley feed lots until the price is right.Although I believe in the efficacy of natural market forces, there are times greed must be checked, especially when harmful to the public.A lot of people have pet reasons for skyrocketing food prices, but the ""real"" reason remains a mystery, even to food experts and economists.As my supermarket friend said: ""When ground turkey goes from 75 cents a pound to 95 cents a pound within two weeks, something is wrong. I have never seen anything like this in my 25 years in the food business.""The best interim solution might be to freeze food prices while we try to isolate the causes. The situation has become critical for many people. Poor families find it impossible to buy enough food for proper nourishment, even with the help of food stamps. Older people on small pensions and fixed incomes can't feed themselves properly. Even middle-income families are beginning to hurt.Secretary Butz suggested that working men stop seeking higher wages and become more productive and that housewives learn how to shop and buy more cheese. He remarked that it's not the high cost of living that bother us but the cost of high living.I wonder if he's ever eaten canned dog food. A lot of poor people do.","1973",0,1

Approximately a fourth of the reactor's nuclear core is replaced at each refueling.PG&E records show the 63,000-kilowatt unit has established an excellent record of avialability for service.The unit's safety record has been recognized by a recent $49,000 refund to the company on its nuclear insurance as a result of 10 years without a single claim arising from nuclear causes. The insuring firms said the safety record of nuclear power plants is uneaulled by that of any other in dustry.During the 10 years of operation the Humboldt Bay reactor has used only 53 tons of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel to provide electricity enough for more than 61,000 average homes over that period.Generating the same amount of electricity in an efficient fossil-fueled turbane generator would require 6 million barrels, or 252 million gallons of oil, PG&E engineers estimated.

Brooke of Massachusetts when he addressed the Congressional Black Caucus annual fundraising dinner in Washington, D.C. The account was contained in an Associated Press dispatch printed recently.""What he is saying, in effect, is what I have been saying in Berkeley for the past two years,"" said Bailey.""""But,"" he added, ""what Brooke says here is belied by what he does in Massachusetts. Looking at the fact of what Brooke himself does and does not do in Massachusetts, in the Roxbury Black community, he does not define himself as a Black politician.""This is to suggest by inference that he means here the total elimination of the Black prespective and the integration of many community perspectives which may be of common interest and agreement to Blacks and whites alike.""If that is his meaning then it is no more than a repeat plea for integration--and I think the manner by which his own political activity is defined would tend to verify that presumption.""Concerning groups with which Blacks might form coalitions. Bailey had this to say:""It must be determined how sincere is their commitment, insofar as recognizing and accepting the need for a special focus on Black problems and Black solutions, which by sound analysis would inure to the total benefit of the community by creating a new bond of intergroup economic and political stability based on some equally shared and fairly allocated wealth and property.""I tend to believe there will be resistance on the parts of major white institutions to the forward thrust of the Black community in general, though they will continue to filter in selected Blacks for the purpose of continuing the cosmetic appearance.""As to the upward movement of the general Black community, which will require massive economic aid from private corporations and the national government that aid is more likely to come as a result of pressure and conflict than it will -- to quote Mr. Brooke -- from 'free-floating coalitions on specific and pragmatic issues,' because it is to the economic interests of the major corporations -- as they narrowly perceive their interests -- to monopolize their gains and profits, without sharing with Black America.""Thus I think it would be necessary for us, while we form our coalitions, to maintain a primary focus on international unity and communications, so as to be able to mobilize our national strength to exert sufficient pressures upon these major corporations to render it more profitable that they share than not share.""And think that means, then, that we must have the capacity to generats nationally coordinater consumer-labor . . . against selected national corporations.""And it would seem to me that labor and political forces which have enjoyed Black involvement and which themselves in recent years have retreated from their own assistance responsibilities should be asked to place their own weight and resources behind such strikes.""When asked specifically how he thought Black communication should be improved Bailey answered:""I think one factor of the economic plan for which we will ask corporate involvement is the allocation of some part of their investment capital toward the financing of acquisitions by Black-controlled groups of major newspaper, radio and television outlets in key Black population centers throughout the country.""For the corporate involvement, this would not be public relations. This would be purely capitalistic venturism. We would be talking about significant investments -- not token investments pegged probably to the percentage of their overall receipts attributable to the Black consuming population.""So, for example, it General Motors receives 10 or 15 or 20 percent of its gross income from the Black population, then that percentage of its economic portfolio should be . . . aside for the financing of Black economic venturies.""This kind of a plan would have to be coordinated by a national economic research and development center -- again controlled by Blacks -- but it has to have as a . . . a national strike center which can coordinate the pressures.""Photo","1973",1,0

At times, she was tempted to doubt it's actual existence.""I fell in love with Sacramento on our trip from the Southern Pacific train station to our home on 3rd Street,"" she admits.It was love at first sight for Mrs. Smith. She relates, ""Sacramento was just big enough to be a small town, and too small to be a big town.""The Smith's lived at 1616 Third Street, their first 10 years here. The Black population at that time, was so small.""When you met a Black person on the Street you knew who they were,"" she said.The Smith's first jobs were at a Black business establishment.""My husband and I worked for the Sacramento Dye House, he as a presser, and I as a finisher and counter girl.""After working at the Sacramento Dye House approximately a year, Smith found employment with the State of California, where he remains today.He is a groundsman for the Department of Human Resources Development. Mrs. Smith worked as a sales clerk after leaving the Dye House, before she found employment with the California State Board of Equalization Mrs. Smith has remained at the State for the past 23 years.When the Smith's left 3rd Street, they moved to another home on Fourth Avenue in Oak Park.""There were people such as Nona Henry and Mrs. LaRue, who had lived there all their lives,"" recalls Mrs. Smith.The Sacramento Redevelopment Agency started it's renewal plans in the Sacramento downtown area or lower-end, and many other displaced families found their way to Oak Park and Del Paso Heights during those years.""Oak Park was beginning to deteriorate and it started to go down when people began to move out to other neighborhoods and rent their houses,"" Mrs. Smith admits.In 1954, Mrs. Smith made her debut in Sacramento Theatre by winning a role in the Eaglet Theatre's production of ""The Little Foxes.""The recipient of many rave reviews, she has appeared in many productions in the past years.She appeared in the Eaglet's production of ""Rain,"" and ""The Miracle Worker,"" as well as played the leading role of ""Mama,"" in the Bread and Butter Theatre production of ""A Raisin In The Sun.""She added her singing and dancing talents to the Elissa Sharee Musical production of ""Frankie and Johnny,"" and at the JayRob Theatre, she has appeared in ""Anniversary Waltz,"" ""Why Does A Chicken?"" ""Crawling Arnold,"" ""Where Have All The Ferries Gone?"" ""The Bees Are For The Birds,"" ""Purlie Victorious,"" and others too numerous to mention. At the Center Players Theatre, she starred in their production of ""Halleleujah Baby.""Mrs. Smith is also a member of the Methodist Actors Serving the Church (MASC). A group of Christian Thespians, who travel over Northern California, Oregon, and Washington, taking their spiritual messages in the form of theatre, music and dance to appreciative audiences. They are currently performing ""Circuits to Ride,"" a play written by a local woman, Mrs. Marge Whitehead.Less than 3 years ago, a dream of a lifetime came true for Mrs. Smith, when she won a speaking part in the Sidney Poitier movie, ""Brother John."" Of her acting, Mrs. Smith says, ""I act because I love it, and it's good therapy. It beats paying a psychiatrist.""Besides being an accomplished amateur actress, Mrs. Smith has been an active participant in community and civic affairs. She is an active member of Les Belles Arts, a Black cultural club, a member of Gamma Phi Delta Sorority, and presently serving on the Board of Directors of the State Women's Club of Sacramento.During the war years, Mrs. Smith did fashion shows and performed in variety shows at the local USO. She has produced and directed many ""Womanless Weddings"" as fund raising activities at several churches.Mrs. Smith's talents seem to be never ending. For the past 25 years, she has written for ""every Black newspaper in Sacramento,"" including the SACRAMENTO OBSERVER. She has also written for the San Franciscobased Sun Reporter, and in recent years, became the Sacramento Union's first Black columnist.Cliffton Smith, or ""Smitty,"" as his friends call him, ""likes working with kids,"" and is active in the Oak, Park Little League. At one time, he served as president and manager. He is also an active member of the Amigos Club. He is secretary of the Kings and Queens Bowling League, and bowls a 158 average.Both Mr. and Mrs. Smith are presently members of Centenniel United Methodist Church.""Sacramento has been good to us. There is a sense of peacefulness. I find in this 'Camellia City.' Where else but in Sacramento, can you walk through the Capitol grounds and see movie stars, the Governor, and all kinds of TV and movie camera men.""Mrs. Smith feels ""I have seen progress as well as deterioration."" Twenty-five years ago, when you met Black people on the street, you knew who they were. Now the city is filled with newcomers. This is progress for sure."" She also recalls when she and her family came, Sacramento didn't have any Black teachers or principals. ""There was only one Black doctor, and Dr. Brewer, was the Black dentist.""The church and the NAACP has been very instrumental in this progress, feels Mrs. Smith. The NAACP has particularly been instrumental in the fight for open housing and better jobs for Blacks.""When we started to get Black real estate men, who could help, things also began to open up.""""I have not lost faith that Sacramento will be counted among the really great cities.""","1973",0,0

Representing all 50 states, they will compete for more than $90,000 worth of scholarships and prizes.The scholarships, valued at $67,000, the other prizes and the all-expense trips to Boston--worth $115,000--will be awarded by Chrysler-Plymouth Division and the Chrysler-Plymouth dealers of America who sponsor the annual competition with the cooperation of the more than 2,000 schools involved.School instructors select their own Trouble Shooting teams on the basis of the knowledge and skill students demonstrate in their regular automobile mechanics class work. There is competition in two classes, one for high school seniors and one for students in post-high school institutions such as community colleges and vocational training centers.Both the regional contests and the National Finals consist of two competitions; a written examination and a mechanical competition, each of which contributes to a team's final score.After being properly weighed, examination scores are combined with the finishing times in the mechanical competition to determine the over-all winners of the contest.In the mechanical portion of the contest, teams are assigned new Plymouth cars in which a series of malfunctions--identical in each team's car--have been placed to keep the car from starting or from running properly. Teams race the clock and each other to restore their cars to normal running order.Teams in the National Finals don't expect to solve the mechanical problems easily. In past contests, malfunctions have ranged from disconnected wires to electrical connections coated with a transparent substance to completely disassembled carburetors.In the 1972 National Finals at Los Angeles, one of the more challenging malfunctions was a fake battery, which had been specially manufactured for the contest. It was absolutely dead. Students had three means of detecting this tricky malfunction; tracing current with a continuity light, checking with a volt meter and testing with a jumper wire. Although most of the teams discovered the inoperative battery within two or three minutes, one team labored 45 minutes before determining that the battery was the cause of their problem.Trouble Shooting is an outstanding example of cooperation between industry and education. It was originated by school officials and Los Angeles Plymouth Dealers in 1949 to help recruit qualified mechanics. It became a national event in 1962 and since then has offered scholarships to 240 students.","1973",0,0

"401","Smallwood, Bill",1973-03-07,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Dr. Maurice Jackson, associate professor at the University of California at Riverside, is one of an unbelievably small number of scientists whose academic lives are dedicated to study the Black aged.A delegate to the second White House Conference on Aging, which drew universal attention, Dr. Jackson at the very outset was firmly convinced -- as he is today -- that the aged are terribly neglected in this country. He feels strongly about the so obvious concentration on youth. That in itself says a number of things about people in society who do not have awareness of their own future, he avers, and the fact that the number of people who share this view is increasing also emphasizes the fact that they regard themselves as ablebodied adults. But their conception of self is future--less as they continue to give a wide berth to the aged.""We ignore the aged at a risk to ourselves."" Dr. Jackson reiterates.Recalling the White House conference, he was delighted to observe that it started the ball slowly rolling toward prodding the administration to begin shaping some policies about needed legislation for the aged. He helped outline some of those priorities.""Social Security, health care, an income package, outreach services, a central national agency coordinating research and information about the aged these should be priorities,"" the sociologist earnestly emphasizes, undaunted at alarming cutbacks of services which President Nixon currently seems so determined to legislate. ""One-fourth of all the country's citizens over 65 years of age are poor and one-half of the Black aged are quite definitely poor.""At UCR since 1965, Dr. Jackson (his three degrees, including a doctorate were earned at University of California at Los Angeles) leads a busy life. Consultant to several groups involved with the aged, he also works with the Advisory Council on the Aging and Aged Blacks to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging and the California Commission of Aging Research Demonstration Task Force.His overall dedication and devotion to geriatrics is a thrust to be marvelled at. One senses that his very being is deeply involved, sensitively and warmly so. If he were to carry aloft a standard, one could easily envision upon it such words as, ""What we think about the aged is important because it reflects what we think about ourselves and our futures.""He feels very intensely about the depressing situation in our land which makes life consistently bleak, unfulfilled and despair--ridden for the aged Black. It haunts him.""There needs are tremendously basic,"" he said. ""They always are in need of food, health care and certainly shelter. A frighteningly large number of Black communities are never without the spectres of service and facility crises. In some cases they may be available but the cold truth about it is they just may not be accessible. An ailing old person, crippled with arthritis and wearing a thin little coat, can't possibly walk nine blocks in February weather to get a bottle of medicine.""For this reason alone -- and there are countless others -- the aged, so often alone in the world, need more and more outreach services, where such blessings come to them. And promptly Not next month or so.Badly needed, also, is a national center for extensive research. It could also well serve as a facility from which there would be wide-spread outpouring of all types of vital information. Basically, there would be invaluable chance to coordinate studies of the aged, their needs and their feelings. That last is so important, indeed. Never could there be too much humaneness involved, here.Dr. Jackson continued. ""There is a great need for knowledge to be made handy because many elderly people do not understand which services are really obtainable to them. It certainly is understandable that they do not take full advantage of them. How could they when they don't know about them?""There has been, to date, an amount of research on the minority aged and far more is needed. Dr. Jackson feels that census data reveals pretty much of the same things on the subject but very, very little in the sociological and psychological, areas. Attitudes, opinions and beliefs of the aged need to be analyzed. Older people need to speak for themselves. Doubtless fascinating would be their replies if all the more interesting questions in the social sciences could be asked of them. He maintains that the aged are an unending source of genuine wisdom which has virtually gone untapped.They are truly a pioneer area as a field of research. Jackson is convinced they provide a storehouse of possibilities and that researchers in the field can make a magnificent contribution, since so much still needs to be done. He has found from experience that they make surprisingly good researchers themselves. In a study of his in four closely aligned areas in south Los Angeles, he hired and trained elderly residents as assistants.""I hired people between the ages of 55 and 81, as interviewers in my project,"" he recalled. ""They covered 95 blocks, contacted 3,455 people and completed 390 interviews.""Beaming and almost reverential, he exclaimed, ""They did a great, great job!"" He said it without hesitation.Photo (Dr. Maurice Jackson)","1973",1,0
"402","",1973-02-10,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Merritt College has submitted a response to the HEW Report of an audit of the financial aids program at the college during the four-year period from July 1, 1968, to June 30, 1972. The report recommends a member of procedural changes that were made approximately a year ago after preliminary review by HEW staff, and also recommends the repayment of $286,000 to cover deficiencies found in the audit, based upon $58,000 of documented alleged discrepancies.The formal response prepared by the financial aids program staff and submitted by President Norvel Smith to the Chancellor of Peralta Community College District and its Board of Trustees has the following reactions:1) The administration of the financial aids program in a college such as Merritt is an extremely difficult and demanding assignment with a large number of low-income students who need financial assistance almost immediately upon enrolling in college, as well as throughout the year in order to remain in college. An almost crisis atmosphere exists year around in dealing with the financial problems of students.2) The Federal regulations concerning these programs are both complex and rigid, and do not recognize the time frame within which students' eligibility has to be established or the immediacy of the need for financial assistance.3) Merritt College, like most community colleges in the State, has inadequate manpower to deal with this critical assignment. Although the volume of the grants and services in this department have grown 75% during the four-year period of the audit, there is still one financial aids officer and one full-time clerical staff member attempting to handle this tremendous volume of service. Three clerical positions have been cut from the student personnel division.4) The college has experienced and is still trying to cope with inadequate management information, such as more frequent data processing reports of the status of students which determine their eligibility, and staff to provide for more frequent and smaller payments of grants throughout the year.5) Perhaps the most critical problem of management and accountability, however, has grown out of the impact of the new non-punitive grading system in effect throughout the Peralta District and in many community colleges throughout the State, which permits students to withdraw from class up to the time of final exams, which in turn reduces the number of units required below those required by Federal regulations, thereby retroactively making many students ineligibile for the assistance already received.6) Annual audits have been conducted during each of the four years in question by the Peralta District's own independent auditors with no such reports of deficiencies as indicated in the HEW adult. However, the most recent report of these local auditors in Dec., 1972, calls attention to the fact that their records have disclosed the fact that the same type of discrepancies found at Merritt by HEW auditors are present in other Peralta Colleges. Unfortunately, only Merritt College was chosen for an in-depth review by HEW.7) The sampling technique used by HEW auditors is extremely questionable, and a recommended disallowance of some $286,000 has been projected from only 107 cases over a four-year period. Of these 107 cases, 64 of theme relate to payments made at the end of one of the school years, based upon extenuating circumstances, a practice which is not technically in violation of Federal regulations.8) The HEW report does not recognize that during the four-year period, there have been significant underawards made to students. The college's own sample of 40 student applications during one of the four years revealed that 34 of them were underawarded by Federal criteria to the extent of $26,000.9) The Report does not make reference to the fact that students who have withheld information concerning supplemental income or resources that affect their eligibility should be held responsible for the repayment of any justified deficiences.In summary, President Smith stated that the audit has simply called to the attention of the college, the Peralta District, and the Board of Trustees the fact that a job of such difficulty and complexity, operated in a constant crisis environment, cannot be performed properly with inadequate manpower and with insufficient management information, and that human error of interpretation of bureaucratic regulations can be expected to occur.Photo (Dr. Norvel Smith Merritt President)","1973",0,0

Everything but the flavoring was measured in pounds. Then the cake was beaten until the batter was smooth and silky. In the ""good old days"" this often took an hour or so.Now, in the good new days, a pound cake that is flavored with a generous measure of fruity California brandy whips together in minutes. Another plus in this modern cake is the addition of dairy sour cream, for an exotic flavor change.Plan a morning of baking and put together two brandied pound cakes. They freeze well, and are versatile beyond belief when it comes to serving. Cut one into thin slices, and set out with tall, tinkling glasses of iced tea as a family snack. When company's coming, slice and top your pound cake with crushed fresh fruit or ice cream. Cube pound cake into dessert dishes and top with a light custard suace. Or, even frost it, if that's your whim of the moment.But probably best of all, is a thick slice of pound cake, still slightly warm from the oven, with a frothy glass of sherbet frappe by its side. Select your favorite fruit sherbet - pineapple, raspberry, orange, or even rainbow. Scoop it into your blender and add aromatic California brandy along with some crushed ice. Whirl at high speed until the frappe is completly smooth, then serve in chilled glasses with a sprig of mint.Because California brandy is a natural product made from grapes, its fruity goodness teams well with other fruits. And your frappes will have a full-fruit flavor that harmonizes well with the buttery slices of pound cake. Pound for pound, a delicious snack any time of the day.SHERBET FRAPPE1 pint pineapple, orange, raspberry or other fruit sherbet1 oz.

While Black civil rights activist Hosea Willians was defeated 78,209 to 44,017 by a Caucasian Wyche Fowler for presidency of the Atlanta City Council Blacks will now have a majority of the council's 18 seats.Unofficial returns gave Jackson 74,404 votes to 51,237 for Massell, but certification of the election will be withheld until the resolution of a court challenge filed on October 11 by Attorney Henry M. Henderson, who charged voting irregularties including misprinted ballots -- in the October 2 clection which preceded this week's runoff. No date has yet been set for the hearing on the chal lenge.Jackson said following the election.""When people ask us what kind of city Atlante is we will answer that it is a city joined by brotherahood. We will answer that Atlanta is the city of the future which answers the human needs of today.""Jackson piled up an overwhelining early lead in the polling and Massell conceded the electiod within four hours of the time the polls had closed offering Jackson all the help he needs.""Congratulations and an offer of cooperation were also extended to Jackson by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter.Meiropolitan Atlanta has 1.5 million residents but the city itself hasless than a third of that number. Fifty-two percent of the city's residents are Black.During the two week runoft campaign, race was the prinlary issue, with Massell linking Jackson and Williams as what he referred to as ""the Jackson Williams leam. He was reported to have said that the team seares Atlantans to death."" Jackson accused Massell during the cams paign of attempting to polarize the city along racial lines.The victory by Blacks in the runoff election could produce a flurrv of annexation bills in the State.

Indians -- with anout a third of Atlanta's population -- has elected Blacks to a similar number of governmental posis. In Newark, Mayor Kenneth Gibson administers a city in tandem with a white controlled city council In he District of Columbia, while Blacks control most city offices, they have been appointed by Congress.Thus Atlanta becomes a model to be closely watched by politicians in other major metropolitan areas as it moves into the area of Black political leader ship. Like the election carlier this years of Thomas Bradley as May or of Los Angeles, the election of Jackson gives Blacks the opportunity to govern a thirving metropolitan area with a bright future.","1973",1,0

Moreover, most of the enterprises requiring only modest capital and limited expertise have been reserved by most African countries for indigenous businessmen.Mr. Patterson, editor-at-large of Black Enterprises magazine, recently returned from a five week tour of Africa where he found United States investment as a whole was small and investment by Black American businessmen nearly non-existent.He said a change in America's attitude toward investing in the huge Continent would help speed its development which now lags behind much of the world.Mr. Patterson visited six countires, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia. While business participation by American Blacks was low in most places there were exceptions, notably Thomas A. Woods' TAW International Leasing, which operates in 11 countries and is the largest American owned operation on the Continent and a lumber company owned by Leon Wood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.The Black Enterprise article contends that is an American Black is to be successful in Africa he must investigate his market personally. He should also be adequately financed and equipped with expertise in the business he is undertaking.What became clear in Africa, the editor concluded, was ""That color is no substitute for competence. The struggling African countries can no more support Black ineptitude than they could the ineptitude of whites.""And to succeed in Africa these businessmen need to be darned good.""Other aspects of Black Africa are also covered in this issue, and the Black Enterprise December interviewee, Robert McNamara, president of the World Bank discusses the Bank's new role in African affairs.","1973",1,0

"409","",1973-08-19,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","In his prompt offer of the ""fullest cooperation"" with the Baltimore U.S. Attorney's investigation of kickbacks in Baltimore county. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew had made a commendable decision. It is, in fact, the second of two correct decisions that have guided his conduct in this affair. The first was not to remove himself from the questioning of the press but rather to stand up, as he did altogether forthrightly last week, and face that music.The Vice President wrote U.S. Attorney George Beall that he had no wish to impede the investigation, he had done nothing wrong, had nothing to hide and would be glad to answer any questions.in taking this position, however, Mr. Agnew said he was not acknowledging that a Vice President in office could with propriety be investigated by any grand jury. This amounted to his saying that he didn't acknowledge that a Vice President could be indicted for wrongdoing.That raises, of course, an interesting constitutional question, and probably it is just as well that the Vice President has spared the courts the strain of having to answer it, for as he says, it ""need not at this moment be confronted.""The question of the indictability of a Vice President is inevitably linked with that of the indictability of a President. Neither question has ever been firmly settled by the courts, though of course the latter is one which has lately been the subject of much informal argument.A leading constitutional lawyer, Alexander M. Bickel of Yale, writes in the New York Times ""I believe he (the President) is not (indictable), prior to impeachment, because in him and in his uninterrupted capacity to function is the indestructibility and continuity of the state itself. A President cannot be indicted before he has been removed and succeeded, so that there is no hiatus in the office.""If a President is unindictable for these reasons, is a Vice President? Opinions vary as to the importance of the Vice Presidency to the continuity of the state, but no doubt the country could get along well enough without the services of a Vice President, whereas it could not do without a President.If a Vice President dies, resigns, is impeached or disabled, he can be replaced by nomination of the President, under the 25th Amendment. Presumably, therefore, if a Vice President were indicted, tried and convicted of a crime, he would thereafter be promptly impeached and, in turn, replaced.The argument that while in office he is beyond the reach of the courts is not so easy to make for a Vice President as it was for President Nixon to make for himself in answer to the Cox subpoena last week. It was then asserted on his behalf that ""if there were any question of presidential involvement"" in the Watergate crimes, ""this would not be within the jurisdiction of this court, the special prosecutor or the grand jury. The President, is liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law for crimes he has committed but only after he has been impeached, convicted and removed from office.""Vice President Agnew has explicitly avoided going that far.","1973",0,0

"411","",1973-11-14,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","Few can look back on the World War II era and the years that followed with such clarity and insight as Simmie FranklinAttracted by promises of warm summers and mild winters, which he thought might be beneficial to his health, Simmie Franklin moved to Sacramento from Berkeley in 1942.The weather was indeed pleasant, but he soon discovered that even Sacramento's warm summers were not enough to breed the kind of brotherly love he had hoped for. On arriving in Sacramento, he was immediately confronted with a major problem - housing. In fact, Mr. Franklin's biggest problem as he states it, ""wasn't a matter of finding a job, but of finding a house.""He remembers: ""It wasn't like it is now, they wouldn't even sell you a house."" The Franklins were forced to rent at a rooming house for six months. They were, however, able to secure a comfortable three bedroom house when the Japanese family who originally lived there was forced to relocate to one of the government concentration camps. The rental fee was $30 per month.The Franklins still tried to buy their own home. Their hopes were temporarily lifted when one realtor told them, ""I got a house we can sell you."" But those same hopes were shattered when he added, ""But I can't take you out there in the day time, I don't want the neighbors to see that I'm selling to a colored family."" The Franklins refused even to consider the home under those conditions. Mr. Franklin feels that we are fortunate that today's housing situation has changed.In 1943, Mr. Franklin was able to purchase what he feels was ""the last house they were willing to sell to a Negro,"" located on Sloatway. He and his family lived there for a couple of years before purchasing a home on Franklin Blvd., in what he describes as ""the country."" They lived on Franklin for another 20 years before moving to their present address.Mr. Franklin's next concern was employment. World War II provided the necessary rejuvination for the economy which was beginning to sag under the weight of the Great Depression. Thousands were employed around the clock in the nation's shops and factories to produce the products necessary to suport our efforts in the war. McClellan Air Base and Southern Pacific Railroad Company were two very large employers of Blacks during those years.Mr. Franklin became one of the many hired in the Southern Pacific Shops. It was not long before he left the SP, for a more stable position with the city. He says: ""I went to work for the city because I thought I might have a job for after the war.""The war, feels Mr. Franklin, radically affected the economics of Blacks in Sacramento. It created many more jobs but it also created a shortage of manpower at the same time. Employers were forced to hire anyone who could do the job and this gave Blacks a chance.California's evacuation of its Japanese-American citizens also greatly affected the economics of Black Sacramentoens, feels Mr. Franklin. ""When the Japanese were removed, Blacks had a chance to try their hands at gardening work and other trades that traditionally the Japanese had done."" Many new Black businesses sprung up where once Japanese businesses had been.Sacramento experienced one of it's most dramatic periods of population growth during World War II. Thousands came to Sacramento to work in it's factories and fields. Many of these thousands were southern Blacks, induced to make the ""great migration"" in hopes of bettering their conditions both economically and politically.Mr. Franklin believes that many of the people who came here were of the ""unsettled type."" He believes: ""people from the south who were doing good and had businesses didn't come out here."" It was those who were dissatisfied with their situations and who had very little to lose by leaving who came to Sacramento during the war years.It was these circumstances that created a potentially explosive situation when the influx of poor Blacks and poor whites began competing with each other for post-war jobs and housing.The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, of which Mr. Franklin has been a member since 1920, was active in dealing with these problems and successful, to a certain extent, in ""breaking down the war of prejudice."" However, as Mr. Franklin sees it, the problem of the poor of both races competing with each other remains a problem today.Mr. Franklin has held the position of membership chairman for 15 years and performed duties on the executive committee for a like number of years. He ardently believes that the NAACP is responsible to a large extent, for the progress that Blacks in Sacramento have made. He believes: ""Without the NAACP we wouldn't have the opportunities we have now.""""The NAACP always worked in a persuasive way to solve problems, remembers Mr. Franklin, we didn't use any threats."" He believes that Sacramento never had any major problems because it's minority population was too small to warrant any, and because the NAACP always worked on problems, ""before they came to a head.""Over the years, the NAACP and Mr. Franklin has been dedicated to improving the quality of education in Sacramento schools, particularly those with a high concentration of minority students.In 1961, Mr. Franklin retired after 30 years of service to the City of Sacramento. He and his wife, Ola, both of whom are members of United Church of Christ, in Oak Park, live quietly with their memories of the Sacramento they knew 30 years ago.","1973",0,1

P. Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania in the June issue of Psychology Today.""Many clinicians have reported an increasing pervasiveness of depression among college students. Since this is a generation that has been raised with more reinforcers--more sex, more intellectual stimulation more buying power, more cars, more music, etc.--than any previous generation, why should they be depressed?""Yet the occurrence of reinforcers in our affluent society is so independent of the actions of the children who receive them, the goodies might as well have fallen from the sky.... Rewards as well as punishment, that came independently of one's own effort can be depressing.""The answer may be the same advice an exasperated father is likely to give his son--get a job.Dr. Seligman writes that the symptoms of depression often are the same as the symptoms of ""learned helplessness""--that is, inability to take action in a situation in the belief it won't make a difference.Doing work that is difficult but gratifying, Dr. Seligman says, is one of the best ways to ""see that one's responses are still effective. It is crucial to succeed. Merely starting and giving up only makes things worse.""Other techniques to alleviate depression include venting anger--""one of the most powerful responses people have for controlling other""--and expressing strong emotion.""Successful therapy occurs when the patient believes that his responses produce gratification, that he is an effective human being,"" says Dr. Seligman.Depression may be brought on by external events, but its cause is internal attitudes toward these events, says Dr. Seligman.Individuals who believe in luck, for example, are more likely to be depressed since they do not believe they can do anything to change their luck. Individuals who believe their success is a result of their own actions are less likely to become depressed and more likely to recover from it quickly.Encouraging an attitude of self control over one's life, Dr. Seligman believes, may be an important element in curing depression and preventing its recurrence.Dr. Seligman says that depression can result from success as well as failure or disappointment. In his article, he points to newly appointed presidents of corporations or astronauts returning from a successful space venture who become depressed.""After a few years of goal-directed activity a person now gets his reinforcers because of who he is rather than because of what he is doing,"" he says.","1973",0,0

Italy, by artist Giovanni Antonio Canale, who was born in Venice in 1697?I imagined that we were gliding down a canal in Venice in a gondola--""we"" being me and Sarah Vaughn as we enjoyed soft music and festive gaiety.Instead, the Truly Divine Sarah was backstage adjusting her dimonds in preparation for her show and I was living it up on liver and bacon in the Venetian Room of the Fairmont Hotel while awaiting the appearance of my very favorite artist, Sassy Lassie Sarah Vaughn, whom I had heard on my car radio just a few, minutes before while driving from Oakland to San Francisco, from her latest album Feeling Good, Alone Again Naturally, an outstanding record.Waiting for the R&B and getting started on the L&B, I wanted to ask the waiter for some down-home Louisiana Hot Sauce and onions to boss up the meal but switched to an impressive ""Pinot Noir, please, nice and dry.""Returning with the wine gave the waiter a chance to explain that the murals were enlarged reproductions of the Italian master's canvases and that if I needed more information General Manager Pete Goodman would be happy to supply it.The Room was a cross-section of many people, including some Brothers and Sisters elegantly dressed. Some of the gowns were back-out or shoulders-out but the lights went out before I could do a tour of inspection.I had my pad and pen and the kindly waiter left my candle lit. Out came Sarah Vaughn, elegantly draped to the floor in diamonds and black velvet. She had to have arrived in a Brinks armored truck.She sang Tonight, Summer and Close to You, the latter a fine number from a movie called Kelly. Then she ran through Misty, Gingerbread Man; Poor Butterfly and Take All of Me. This gave Sarah a chance to scat and riff and the trio a chance to work out, showing themselves to be a very fine group.Sarah does everything well with her eyes closed--and don't ask how I know. She sings sweetly and elegantly and does many other things musically, I know.I sat back and remembered yesteryear and the great songs she sang with Billy Eckstine, Dizzie Gillespie and Earl ""Fatha"" Hines. They paid a record session place $20 to let her have her first recording session, in 1940.Hines, I recall, had a famous record back in the 1950s with a line, ""Play it again 'til 1976."" Man, that's just around the corner! It goes to prove that good blues, like good cornbread, is good any time.It's a great show for anyone who likes good music, especially with liver and bacon. You can catch Sarah Vaughn tonight--Wednesday, March 7. (If not, Trini Lopez starts Thursday for 10 days.) But take along a reverse doggiebag of Louisiana Hot Sauce and onins to boss up your liver.It's a hard combination to beat--good liver with all the trimmings and Sarah Vauglin trimmed in diamonds!Illustration","1973",0,0

In the last week my spirit has been low and with the announcement by your researcher that more Black folk got high blood pressure than the white folk and what it does for us, I just ain't in no kind of festive mood.Then too, Dick, I hear all of those demonstrators are gonna disrupt your events on account of they feel your 'war plan is a big bomb.'When I called my travel agent, BILLYE DUNLAP, she tells me the cheapest she can put me into Washington would be $318 round trip. That I could possibly scrap up - but the $150 you have to pay to get to one of the inaugural balls, $150 for a sterling silver inaugural plate, $50 for a sterling silver inaugural medal, $5 for the inaugural book, $15 for a set of sterling silver inaugural license plates (good thru January) and finally, the $50 reserve seat for the grand inaugural parade. I just ain't got it. Money was a little short before you put on the 2-month freeze, but since your announcement January 8, money is tighter than Dick's headband.Now, Dick, I sho nuff, for real want to go to SAMMIE DAVIS junior's ""American Heritage Party,"" the $10 cultural event at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in D.C. Friday night. That's got to be a gas. I hear Sam, your cut-hugging buddy, is gonna put on a r-e-a-l-l-y b-i-g show.....that he's gonna surprise his guests with an appearance by none other than FRANK SINATRA and number one soul brother JAMES BROWN. Along with the art and entertainment there will be cultural foods which will include baklava, bagels, soul food (chitterlings?) and tocos -(real cultural, huh?). This event I am truly gonna miss attending. I hear you're gonna take my suggestions of a few columns ago and appoint Sam ""Ambassor to Everything"" on account of he's so multi-talented and this also aids in cutting down government spending.Dick, I want you to know my friends are doing their all to help me get to the affair because they know I will do some honest reporting. OTHO GREEN has offered me his Washington apartment for the weekend. He's the young Black dude running for Mayor of Oakland in the April elections..My friend RUTH CHATMAN said she'd make my inaugural ball gown - but that doesn't take care of the other four gowns I'd need to cover all of the other events. I gotta budget $100 per gown and that's $400. I wouldn't be caught dead in the same garb twice.I hear taxi fare and hotel rates are gonna hit the sky. I will also need about $100 for miscellaneous items.Dick, would you believe that tallies about $1,383.00 and that doesn't include the money I'd have to spend on thermal drawers, fur coat, mittens and overshoes - things I don't need for the Berkeley climate.You see Dick, if you hadn't come down so hard with your 2-month freeze, cut in government spending, pouring all of that money in Vietnam, cutting the poverty programs and what about those bets you had on the Washington Redskins...you see I may have been able to view the situation a little better had not you made it so bleak and bomby.I just can't make. I did so want to chat with Spiro again. He's been so quiet lately...why he ain't cuss the press out in months.Now I know how you love little children and where you heart is toward humanity and I found out from Pat at the Rose Bowl game that you're right on top of ""Child care,"" so instead of coming to the big event in Washington, I plan to send a contribution to one of your pet projects - ""Child Care in Hanoi.""My special regards to Pat, Trica and Julie. Tell them to insist that NBC, ABC and CBS don't do close-ups of them during the raising of the flag - (they always come out looking so phoney).Please convey my regrets also to our two Black leaders - Sam and James....and tell Sammie - no more of this ""Miami hugging"" with you.-Peace by any means necessary - in 1973 - edie baby!","1973",0,1

"427","Skinner, Samuel J, Jr",1973-06-27,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","BAKERSFIELD, California---Lying in bed during the running of the AAU Nationals, I couldn't help but think about the situation regarding the charges of racial bias during the running of the NCAA track and field track meet in Baton Rouge, Louisiana two weeks ago.The thing which upset me most of all was the fact those who charged the area with discrimination waited fill they returned to the safety of their home area before sounding off loudly and clearly, leaving the situation which involved the racial discrimination still as it was without attempting to rectify the situation while it was happening.There is the situation reported about one of the African runners, John Ngeno of Washington State University, who upon going across the street to a McDonald's hamburger stand in Baton Rouge was refused services and threatened.It's said that the young man was kept under lock and key somewhat and didn't venture far away from the dorm area for the rest of the meet.How about assistant track coach Larry Livers of San Jose State and head mentor Willie Williams of Arizona who told of being refused entrance into several night clubs and being called ""nigger"" on many occasions?Being called a nigger by white folks, I'm sure, didn't happen here for the first time to either Livers or Williams, but it surely wasn't expected during the running of a championship event.But let's look at the situation from another view, without being emotional about the fact that it happened and shouldn't have taken place.What did these persons do about the situation while there? The track and field part of the NCAA track meet was a three day affair and surely someone should have heard about it before their return to homeland the following week. Not a peep was heard from any reporters in the area and I sat and talked with one of the persons who levelled these charges, coach Ken Shannon of the University of Washington, and spoke with several athletes on the field around the dorms--not one reported of anything going wrong.One thing that upset me is since these things took place what did these people do about getting the law to alleviate the suffering that people were enduring at that moment, not after the fact some four or five days later?Surely not one person reported the sptuation to the athletic director Carl Maddox, who was most available in seeking out people, questioning them about how things were going and if they were encountering any problems.There were those of us who rode trains and buses during the Freedom Rides of the early sixties, fighting to get a public accomodation law passed and successfully did so, only to see those people encountering discrimination and not using the law.Sure the Justice department and FBI have entered the case now and the long process of investigation of the charges has begun. If it had been reported to the Justice Department during the actual discrimination, however, the FBI and Justice Department could have been sitting in those establishments the following night and arrests could have been made then.Or better yet, I'm sure that if Louisiana State University, which did the canvassing of night spots and the area beforehand, making sure that nothing like this would take place, would have received this type of information, its athletic director could have notified the police chief about the problems being encountered.But to scream loud some days after an injustice had been done, without having reached the people who could have done something about it right then and there--I question the leadership ability of those making the charges.If one student is suffering an injusticd or one coach suffers an injustices, that injustice should be eradicated immediately and on the spot; those charged with taking care of many others should knwo that if injustice is being forced upon anyone at anytime, it's to be attacked at the source of the injustice then and now.Sure it makes nice newspaper print after the fact to holler loud and clear, but for those who suffered the indignity of discrimination, it does nothing for them at the time of the injustice.In the University of Washington case, they have two people who won't stand for this kind of injustice to any student athlete in assistant athletic director Don Smith and the head man Joe Kearney.Not once did either of these people receive a call from the head coach. I'm sure, that if Smith had been contacted he would have been on the first thing smoking out of Seattle heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And before leaving he would have been on the phone with athletic director Carl Maddox questioning him about the discrimination reports from the University of Washington head coach.In this day and age, ther's no place for discrimination which the public accomodates and no reason for people not to know where to go and get help in alleviating the suffering caused by discrimination.Baton Rouge won't be the last place where people will run up against discrimination, because it can happen anywhere and does from Seattle, to St. Louis, from San Francisco to Bakersfield. Surely it could happen in Austin, Texas, next year because bigotry is something mankind won't have rid itself of in 1973.","1973",0,1

Simpson enjoyed his fourth successive 100-or-better rushing day last week against Philadelphia, (6 in a row if his last two ganies of 1972 vs Detroit and Washington are included) and it was inevitable that a spetral presence was noted running alongside. O. J. Simpson isn't just running against American Football Conference defenses now. He's hooked up in a duel with the ten-year old greatest rushing record in the game, Jim Brown's 1,863 yards for the 1963 season.Cleveland had Jim Brown that year, the New York Giants had a balding gent of indeterminate age named Y. A. Tittle and the edge was just enough to give the Giants the conference championship by a one game margin over the Browns.Ten years later O. J. Simpson has boosted a Buffalo club which had been struggling its way up from the bottom at this time a year ago, into a first place the with Miami's Super Bowl champions in the AFC's Eastern Division race. Last week, against a stubborn Philadelphia club in the first of Buffalo's three inter-couference clashes. O. J. galloped 171-yards and one TD on 27 carries.The single game yardage was O. J's third-best ever. In the season's opener he set the NFL mark of 250 vs. New England on 29 carries. Last year vs. Pittsburgh he somehow accounted for 189 yards on 22 carries in a losing effort.After four games O. J's and Brown's record pace are amazingly close. Simpson has . . . yards on 102 carries; Brown had 664 on 78. Here is how they shape up on a game-by game basis.        O. J.

Y. Giants            23   123No matter how successful O. J. proves in his apectavular assault on Brown's record he would still have a few heights to scale, even if he did top Brown's 1,863. For instance, when O. J. racked up 1,251 to lead the NFL a year ago with a club whose record was 1-9-1; it gave him the distinction of having produced the 11th best effort in NFL single-season history. The other ten' Seven belong to Brown, two to Green Bay's Jim Taylor, the other to Jim Nance. And three of these marks were set by Brown in a 12-game season.They line up thusly. I. Brown, 1963 - 1,863; 2. Brown, 1965 - 1,544 this farewell year); 3. Brown, 1958 - 1,527 (12 games); 4. Taylor, 1962 - 1,474; 5. Nance, 1966 - 1,458; 6. Brown 1964 - 1,446; 7. Brown, . . . - 1,408; 8.

Intelligence Scale standardized in the United States -- including one for southern Blacks -- and also Binet tests for France, England, Australia. India, Brazil, Switzerland and Scotland.The pattern of lower scores, she noted occured whether tests were revised for southern Blacks or for foreign ethnic groups -- thus yielding strong evidence that the revisions themselves were affecting the scores.""Tests revised for various national groups generally used the latest previous revision as a model and each succeeding revision produced scores that were always lower than the original,"" she added.She also pointed out that the amount of revision a test was given correlated with differences in mean percent passing scores.""Tests with little revision produced higher scores than those with a great deal of revision,"" she said.She described I.Q. scores earned by minority and lower socioeconomic groups in the United States who were administered the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale as reflecting the characteristics of the test rather than the test takers.She explained that the test was not revised to fit exactly each group's unique qualities and was always administered to the group at a later time than when the original form was published.Her study showed there was a way to measure cultural loading of each question on the Binet test.","1974",0,1
"434","Ortiz, J Shawn",1974-04-24,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, democratic contender for governor, may have killed his chances of becoming governor this week.Alioto has virtually placed San Francisco's Black community in ""a state of siege,"" following the shooting death of 23-year-old Nelson T. Shields IV.Although Blacks constitute only seven per cent of the state's population they will be approximately 20 per cent of the state's democratic voters casting ballots in the upcoming June primary.Many political observers are questioning whether Alioto's actions to abduct the so-called ""Zebra killer"" are really necessary. Alioto's extreme measures in dealing with the murders, is viewed upon by many concerned Black spokesmen as ""political suicide.""Black backlash is certain to take its toll on Alioto's alleged popularity at the polls.Opinions within the Black community tend to substantiate claims that Alioto is ""finished"" as far as the Black vote is concerned.In the wake of the shooting death of Shields, Alioto has ordered the city's police department to stop all Blacks fitting the composite description provided them by attacked survivors and witnesses. Twelve persons have been slain in the San Francisco shootings and six wounded since they began last November. All but one of the victims have been whites shot allegedly by a Black gunman.Mayor Alioto claimed at a press conference this week that his action ordering the stopping and questioning of Blacks fitting the composite description was not racial.""I want the people of San Francisco to understand that this is not a racial issue, but it is a blunt fact that the victims are white and our description says the suspect is Black,"" stated Alioto.In what is being described as ""a police action without parallel in San Francisco history,"" hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes officers armed with a composite drawing of the alleged ""Zebra killer,"" have been ordered into the streets to find him.The composite description provided by surviving victims and an undisclosed female witness, describe the ""Zebra killer"" as-being 20 to 30 years of age, 5-foot-9 to six feet in height, with a long narrow face wearing a knit cap. He is also reported to be sporting a slim mustache and a possible goate.According to San Francisco Police Chief, Donald Scott, only persons fitting the description will be stopped and questioned.""We're not going to stop every young Black or big fat Blacks. We're not going to stop seven-foot Blacks,"" stated Scott.With nearly 50 per cent of the Black male population in San Francisco under 25-years-old, and given equal consideration that most Black males between 18 and 30 wear some sort of mustache or the popular goate, there are fears that very few will escape questioning.The scanty description provided police and the traditional image of law enforcement within the Black community raises serious fears in the middle of concerned Blacks.Alioto admits that the massive manhunt is extreme. ""This is an extraordinary situation and it calls for extreme measures. We are going to be stopping people in San Francisco who have a certain profile. We're going to be stopping a lot of people,"" stated Alloto.There is likewise the suspicion that Alioto actions may be in the interest of his democratic gubernatorial bid.Alioto rationalized his ""extreme measures"" by saying, ""You can't live your life in perpetual fright"" and added a message of concern that whites should be ""careful.""23-year-old Robert Brooks, questioned and detained for 20 minutes, by two plainclothes officers, perhaps best described the majority feelings of many Blacks throughout the state, concerning Alioto's extreme measures.""Alioto is prosecuting the Black community for the acts of a few crazy dudes.""The tremendous press coverage given ""Operation Zebra,"" as it is being called by the San Francisco police department, certainly serves as a forum for Alioto's campaign for governor.His actions certainly indicate a low lack of respect for the safety and well-being of the city's Black community. Actions threatening the constitutional rights of any citizen should be taken into consideration by any official charged with administrating the publics trust.Strangely enough, Alioto's measures are similar in nature to South Africa's pass system. The pass system, is a book given each Black at birth and is carried until death or arrested. The book contains vital information such as birth place, parents racial ancestry, place of employment, residency, number of children as well as information saying where the person can and cannot go.Although Alioto is not passing out any books he is in effect limiting the travel of Blacks within San Francisco through intimidation.It is possible, that Blacks stopped under Operation Zebra, could go to jail for outstanding parking tickets, or for non-payment of child support.Operation Zebra, recalls visions of Hitlers Storm troopers bulling their way through Jewish communities, except in their place, we find the San Francisco police department looking for a man who fits the description of thousands of young Black males.","1974",0,1

This requires broadcasters ""to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance"".Cranston said ""there is reason to believe more freedom for the broadcaster would actually increase the airing of controversial opinions.""""The fairness doctrine often actually inhibits the broadcasting of controversial programs or opinions because some broadcasters are afraid of 'trouble'. with the FCC when it comes time for them to seek a renewal of their licenses,"" Cranston said.Cranston noted that both Senator McClellan and the Florida Supreme Court suggested that the FCC's ""fairness doctrine"" for electronic media should also be applied to print media.""I strongly disagree,"" Cranston said. ""Instead of giving the government power to interfere with newspaper editorials, we should be seeking ways to do away with government interference in radio and television.""Cranston said he agrees with the principles of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy recommendations last month that programming on cable television channels be allowed to develop ""on a free and competitve basis, with no more regulatory power exercised over the content of this communications medium than is exercised over the print or film media"".""For the past year I have had my staff researching how this same freedom can also be granted commercial and public television,"" Cranston said.Cranston said he also disagreed with Senator McClellan's assertion that a national right to reply law ""is now even more urgent in light of court decisions in libel cases which virtually deprive public officials of the opportunity to recover damages unless they can prove malice"".""That's the chance a person has to take when he decides to run for public office,"" Cranston said.","1974",0,1

Yet to the long-held complaint that Johnny can't read or do math, and the more recent revolt against rising and often inequitable school costs, has been added a perhaps more serious charge, All too often professional critics, over worked teachers or parents, beleaguered by the inability of their children to succeed in school, say the raditional approaches of the sublic school, especially troubled inner city schools are coercive and demeaning or at best mindless.Far from . . . the promise of their publics, the schools seem to . . . or reflect socia . . . and all but condemn, children to the dead-end jobs and limited future of those who acquire neither the educational level nor the me vation and the confidence needed to do well . . . highly complex society The schools are at fauit, these critics sas because they expect no better or do not try hard to take into account the cultural diversity of city students. Even middle-class families have sometimes come to feel desperate because their children are not being reached by traditional schooling Many it seems want the schools to change fewer can suggest how this might be accomplished.The temptation over the past decade has been to give up on the idea of directly changing the existing schools because school systems have become so very large and complex and are weighted down by complicated procedures which inhibit their ability to carry out new programs and approaches Instead, many administrators, teachers, and parents have hoped that by starting from scratch on a small scale, they could design ""alternative"" or ""experimental"" schools to emphasize individualized methods of learning responsive relationships between teachers and learners and community participation in the schooling of its youngsters. The result-motivated and enthusiastic students and hence better learning as the reasoning goes would pressure the traditional public schools to change by the force of such accomplishment.Three educators of such persuasion-Richard Johnson. Donald Moore and Thomas Wilson, who had had experience in teaching and educational jesearch and evaluation, worked on the arduous task of helping to develop Chicago's Metropolitan High School, a public alternative school not far from the city's busy downtown area. Metro allows its students, who are chosen by lottery from a host of eager applicants from all over the city, great individual choice and encourages other-than-classroom learning by initiating courses at everything from art museums to businesses. It has not survived without turmoil and re-thinking, but Metro has become an exciting development in public education.In an effort to capitalize on Metro's experience in alternative education, Johnson, Moore, and Wilson formed the Center for New Schools in Chicago to provide information and to help public systems, throughout the Midwest that wanted to initiate alternative schools. The Corporation backed the Center with a grant as part of its developing program in elementary and secondary education, which is focusing on the process by which schools are able to incorporate changes. Without some research and technical assistance to guide new programs and a place for people to learn about what has worked-and what has failed-in alternative schooling, such sincere endeavors risk being little more than a fad. Moreover, the Center does not assist just teachers or just admiristrators, but insists that effective education requires the commitment of many groups-administrators, school boards, and parents as well as teachers.Over the last two years, the Center has had its successes in effecting change in public schools, but what is interesting--and not altogether atypical--is how knowledge gained from their successes have in turn, reoriented the work of the organization. Explains Center associate Moore. ""We've found that an alternative school may do great things for 350 students, but in itself is incapable of changing the system."" Experiments tend to get isolated from the main-stream of a school system where school personnel often more comfortable with traditional approaches and without specific pressure to implement new ways, continue to work on the press of regular business and let new ideas get watered down. The lesson, says Moore ""The people who can best exert a meaningful force to change the schools are the parents who are ""there"" and who are concerned not with the system's philosophy but with their children. As one mother puts it. ""I know that change has to relate to my kid and I want to be effective in my school.""At the same time that expertise doesn't count without pressure for change, the inverse holds, too Neighborhood concern may be able to gain influence in schools, but without some understanding of what they might do such force is not meaningful in the long run Says one Chicago foundation executive: ""I keep asking outraged parents. And what are you going to de after you get rid of the honky principal?""So while continuing research, and work with alternative schools throughout the Midwest, the Center is concentrating on assisting local Chicago groups involved in improving their public schools. For instance in an area on the North side the Pilsen Neighbors; a Mexican-American group, were distraught over the lact that 70 percent of their youngsters do not finish in the high school several miles from then home. They had fought a long campaign to have the Board of Education establish a Chicanco high school in their neighborhood. Once a construction was approved, however, the Neighbor's contact with the Center helped them to see that a new building alone was unlikely to change the educational experience and performance of Chicano students.So with the help from the Center the group has done the research to come up with a comprehensive set of proposals for the new school-including everything from bilingual education to work-based learning. And the group influenced the board of education to immediately start a pilot school that would test out the community plan. This program, far from merely attacking the failings of the current school, presents an analysis of what they see as the most promising way of overcoming the . . . tartly, the Center . . . not lay out a plan of the group but helped examine different approaches Says Lola Navarro a member of the community council.

"447","",1974-01-20,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Just about everyone knows Alaska is the biggest state in the Union - way bigger than Texas. It is the northernmost state and it has the highest mountain in North America, Mt. McKinley which towers 20,320 feet into the sky.But here are some more ""gee-whiz"" statistics on the 49th state. They may stump you - then again, they may not. If you can answer one-fourth to one-half, you are more knowledgeable about Alaska than most.What state devotes the smallest area to agriculture? Although it is the largest state, Alaska devotes the smallest area of any state to raising food crops, exlusive of grazing land. Only about 72,000 acres are devoted to agriculture, with the largest areas being the Matanuska Valley, near Anchorage, and the Tanana Valley, near Fairbanks.Besides Donner and Blitzen and Dancer and Prancer and Rudolph, how many reindeer make their home in Alaska? Approximately 40,000 with most on the Seward Peninsula.In 1968, what historic event happened on the Alaska North Slope? Discovery of the richdst oil deposits in the history of the United States. Sale of the oil leases brought the Alaska State Government $900 million in one day.How many operating railroads are there in Alaska? Only two - the Alaska Railroad, which schedules trains on a regular basis between Anchorage and Fairbanks and, when traffic warrants, to Seward on the Gulf of Alaska; and the White Pass and Yukon Route, one of the few operating narrow gauge lines in the world. This Canadian-owned railroad runs some 110 miles from Skagway, Alaska, through a tip of British Columbia to Whitehourse, Yukon Territory. It is some of the most scenic terrain in the world.Which is closer to Alaska - Honolulu or Chicago? It's a close race, but Honolulu wins by a whisker. Anchorage-Honolulu is 2,721 miles compared with Anchorage-Chicago, 2,347.What Navy sunk the largest number of what country's vessels in . . . Pacific waters during what war? No, it wasn't Japan, Russian or even the British Navy. It was the U.S. Confederate warship Shenandoah which sunk 34 U.S. whaling vessels in the Gulf of Alaska during and after the Civil War in 1865.While on the subject of the Civil War, where was the last shot of the conflict between the states fired?

"448","",1974-06-05,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","California Homemakers Association (CHA) has dropped a suit against the Sacramento County Welfare Department after the department put an end to practices that CHA claimed violated ""the civil rights of its members.""The CHA had filed suit on May 7, 1974, asking the court to put a halt to the Welfare Department's questioning of home care attendants about their affiliation with the organization.Home care attendants are domestics who perform household and hygenic chores for welfare recipients who are unable to care for themselves. CHA represents approximately 2,200 domestic workers.CHA maintained the questioning by social workers of domestics about their affiliation was a type of harassment. As . . . consequence, many domestics were afraid to join the organization for fear their hours or wages would be cut, said a spokesman for the organization.County Welfare Director William Redmond has instructed his staff to end the practice of questioning domestics about their affiliations.To insure that the practice is stopped, the question itself was deleted from the form used by the staff.Redmond claims that even before the suit was filed he had ordered an end to the practice.CHA was formed a little more than a year ago by a small group of area domestic workers in an effort to win the right to a minimum wage and improved working conditions.In Marcli of this year, the Board of Supervisors recognized CHA as a bargaining agent for domestic workers and instructed the county to enter into individual contracts with home care attendants as represented by CHA.That decision was hailed as a ""historic first in the nation"" by CHA officials.However, the decision did not solve all of CHA's problems. CHA says the new guidelines for payment of attendants issued by the county will cause drastic cuts of 30 to 30 per cent in attendants income.The guidelines provide that attendants will no longer be paid by the hour for the chores performed but according to time alloted for each chore.For example, the new guidelines allot .5 hours once a week for shampooing of handicapped welfare recipients, one hour a week is allowed for laundry. Regardless of how long it takes the attendant to do the job, he will only be paid for the time allowed to do the chore.In written explanation of the pay method Redmond said the system was necessary to standardize the pay of attendants. Otherwise workers in ""two different homes could receive substantially different amounts of pay for performing essentially the same work because one is slower than the other,"" said Redmond.Redmond also said the new pay system would prevent workers from inflating their wages simply by working slower.According to a CHA spokesman, most domestic workers incomes are far below poverty lines. It was only this year that domestic workers were included in federal minimum wage legislation.CHA tries to compensate for member low incomes by offering medical and dental assistance. It also has a ""free pantry"" where members may receive free food.The organization does not however limit its services to members only. During the months of January and February, many baskets of free food were distributed to the elderly whose social security checks were delayed.","1974",0,1

""Through our district service manager in training program, Oldsmobile will be able to continue to staff our field organization with qualified personnel with a service career goal.""Although far from being a new program, Oldsmobile's district service manager in training efforts place it atop the industry for finding, training and utilizing divisional service personnel.In 1961, the program was established to hire persons with solid educational and service backgrounds and train them specifically for field service work. A total of 21 persons are involved in the program at one time and as one person moves into a field job a new trainee moves into the program. The program is designed to cover a two-year period, although occasionally someone moves through training faster.""Most of those entering training today have dealership service experience and some college,"" according to Oxendale. An applicant is usually in his 20s. The service personnel in the Olds zones, who are often graduates of the program, find a majority of the trainees selected for the program. An interview and careful evaluation follows each application.""We know exactly what type of person and background we're looking for and we've been fortunate in being able to fill the program with outstanding young people,"" Oxendale said.The training program is conducted in the division's service headquarters in Lansing. ""From the moment a trainee begins his career at Oldsmobile, he's engaged in some type of productive service work assignment,"" said Oxendale.A number of job assignments are handled by the trainees including transportation claim processing, service promotion, owner and service publications, flat rate time studies, garage technical work, computer file maintenance and customer service. The background of a trainee, to some extent, determines what areas he spends the most time in.""Since these people ultimately will work in the field,"" said Oxendale, ""they're encouraged to learn all they can about the divisional offices in Lansing and exactly how these facilities can help them when they are on the job as district service managers.""The program also gives the trainees a chance to work with computers in several phases of the training. Computers are becoming more a service department tool, as more uses for computerized equipment are being found.When we recruit people for our district service manager in training program we emphasize the word career to them, because hopefully they are into something they'll be doing the rest of their working days,"" said Oxendale.

And, when sunlight hits snow and is reflected up into the eye, there is no natural defense against the two most damaging rays -- ultraviolet and infrared.""A concentration of these rays may burn the delicate inner lining of the eye, resulting in pain and possible permanent eye damage,"" warns Dr. Richard Rosenberg, the society's public information director. ""Although most ready-made ski goggles have plastic lenses, the most effective lenses to absorb injurious invisible light rays are professionally-prescribed, impact resistant, tinted glass lenses,"" says the optometrist.The sun need not be shining at all for the rays to be present since most of the ultraviolet rays entering the eye are reflected from the snow itself, according to Dr. Rosenberg.The best color lenses to protect your eyes in snow country? It's neutral gray, which reduces all light ray wave lengths about the same amount, according to leading optometrists.To maintain a wide, unobstructed field of vision, skiers should wear large frames, yet side pieces should not block side vision. If possible, goggles or sunglasses should conform to the facial contour to protect eyes from wind: Frames should fit snugly over the bridge of the nose and the ears to prevent them slipping off.","1974",0,0

Poor minority participation was found in administrative service, engineering and maintenance, front office, cashiers, PBX, and security jobs.Women make up 46 percent of the total workforce reported in data provided by the forty member hotels of the Hotel Employers.

"473","Randall, Peter",1974-05-22,"Sacramento Observer (1968-1975)","EDITOR'S NOTE: Church campaigns against the doath penaity may be partly responsible for a significant drop in the number of execurions in South Africa. This articie by Peter Randall is made available through the courtesy of Africa Acts.By the early 1960's, South Africa was said to have the highest rate of judicial killing in the world. The majority of those executed were (and still are) black.In a ""study-document for South African Christians"" called ""The Church and the Death Penalty"" issued four years ago, I attempted to analyze the occurrence of capital punishment in South Africa. In summing up the position at that time, I listed ""four striking facts about capital punishment in South Africa"":* The number of persons executed had risen dramatically over the previous twenty years;* The percentage of condemned people who were reprieved had decreased sharply;* The range of offences for which the death penalty could be imposed had widened;* There was an apparent lack of concern about the position -- in Government circles, in the Press, in the Church (with the exception of the Presbyterian Church), and in other areas of national life to which one looks for informed and enlightened leadership.Between 1911 and 1947, fewer than 25 people were hanged on an average each year. From 1948 to 1966 the figure stood at more than 66 a year, while it rose to more than 80 during the decade 1957 to 1966. The peak was reached in 1968 when 118 people were executed.If one looks at the picture now, nearly 4 years after my study, one is immediately struck by the decided decrease in the application of the death penalty over the past few years. In the year 1968 - 1969, 84 executions were carried out, a decrease of 15 from the previous corresponding period. (The bulk of the hangings were of African men convicted of murder). In the year 1969-70, the figure dropped slightly again to 80, with another 28 death sentences being commuted to life imprisonment.The most dramatic decrease occurred in 1970-71, when 56 people were executed -- this approximating the figures of about 20 years previously, despite the growth of population during this period. Present indications are that this trend is being maintained.It is of interest to note also that there seems to be a trend towards fewer sentences of corporal punishment (the number of offenders sentenced to flogging in 1971-72 decreased by 891, or 16.4 percent, compared with the previous year) and in the total numbers of people imprisoned in South African jails.Total numbers ofsentenced prisoners        Year496,071                   1968-69484,661                   1969-70474,065                   1970-71440,922                   1971-72(statistics from ""Survey of Race Relations in South Africa,"" S.A.I.R.R.)The trends -- a decline in the number and proportion of executions, less imprisonment -- should be seen in conjunction with each other and as indicating a movement towards enlightenment. While giving some cause for satisfaction, however, these trends must not obscure the fact that, as Mrs. Helen Suzman MP pointed out in Parliament in 1973, ""the size of the prison population remains a sad reflection on society.""During 1972, Justice J. H. Steyn drew attention to the fact that there was an alarming disparity between the prison populations of South Africa and other countries, for example!Country                  Daily average[*]South Africa                        417England                              72France                               70Belgium                              63Sweden                               61Norway                               44Netherlands                          25[*]No. of prisoners per 100,000 of the population.The fact of a Supreme Court judge making this kind of observation is relatively rare in South Africa and is symptomatic of a growing concern by the Bench. Over the past five years there has been a growing climate of concern in the legal profession, the Churches and the Press for penal reform.The decline in the use of the death penalty must be seen in this overall context. The past few years have seen the forming of bodies like The Society for the Abolition of the Death Penalty (under the leadership of a law professor, Barend van Niekerk), a criminology institute at the University of Pretoria, and the National Institute for Crime.Prevention and Rehabilitation of Prisoners (NICRO) under the chairmanship of a judge. Academics like Prof. Ellison Kahn of the University of the Witwatersrand and Dr. David Welsh of the University of Cape Town have continued to campaign for the abolition of capital punishment.The South African Government, however, has continued to reject any idea of abolition, using as one of its arguments ""the unique and complex racial composition of our country."" It has even resisted calls for a comprehensive commission of inquiry into the subject. These calls have come from within the legal profession, from academics, from Mrs. Helen Suzman, the lone Progressive Party MP, and from the Churches.It is difficult to assess the role of the Churches in all this -- both the creation of a more enlightened attitude towards penal reform generally, and the continued resistance of the Government to any moves towards through-going reform -- but I believe it to be significant. On the one hand, theologinas of the Dutch Reformed Churches have continued to defend capital punishment on Biblical grounds. On the other hand, the South African Council of Churches (SACC) and its member churches have continued to express concern.The publication by the SACC of ""The Church and the Death Penalty"" in 1970 probably helped to focus the attention of member churches on the issue. The SACC followed-up this publication by calling a one-day symposium on the subject at its next annual conference. The subsequent conference of the Methodist Church and the Synod of the (Anglican) Church of the Province of South Africa both passed resolutions calling for an inquiry into the practice of capital punishment.Typical of the concern felt by many Christians was a statement by the Methodist Church noting ""with concern the high rate of executions in South Africa; the state of lawlessness, murder, and economic insecurity which this appears to reveal; and the doubts expressed concerning the justification and effectiveness of capital punishment.""Despite the decrease in the number of executions over the past four years, the picture remains essentially the same.","1974",0,1

For two cars, in a lot of instances, can SAVE fuel consumption and a lot of time too, for a family.To manage a second car without wrecking the family budget, try putting aside say $50 a month (make it $12.50 a week and it's easier).After a year, you'll have $600 to make a down payment on a new or used car. After that, the $50 (or more if you can manage it) in monthly car savings can go toward the payments.But once you acquire the second car, start working toward an ideal two-car budget, the kind that helps you avoid finance charges. Continue to bank money every month in a car account. What you set aside depends on the automotive price class that suits your family's needs and pocketbook.Once a year you can draw from the account to buy a new or used car. In that way, you're keeping each car for two years, replacing one each year.Although it's the perfect way to be a two-car family, this system may take a while to work out.Says one budget-wise head of a two-car family, ""It took us about three years before we got enough ahead so we could set aside $25 a week toward a new car.""The best part of the system, is that you're avoiding finance charges that can amount to several hundred dollars on a two-or three-year loan.There's an added bonus when you withdraw the money from your car savings account. Instead of paying interest yourself, you've been collecting it from the bank at 4-1/2 per cent.As to whether the newest car goes to the male or female head of the family, that's a decision that can cause a marital crisis, but the fuel shortage can help solve it. If possible, give the car with the lowest gas consumption to the highest-mileage driver.To work that second car into the family budget, figure out what you want to accomplish with your available income. Add up your yearly fixed expenses, such as the automobile, taxes, rent or mortgage payments, utilities, insurance and savings.Then keep a record of day-to-day living costs such as food, sitters, cleaning and car upkeep for a month or so.Next figure your flexible expenses. That's the money you spend for clothing, home improvements, newspapers, and magazines, doctors and dentists, gifts and recreation. Total it up to see if the funds can be stretched to include a second car. If you find it will require cuts somewhere, the easiest place to make them usually is in the flexible expenses.There's help available from counseling services if you have a problem setting up a workable budget.The service is offered free, or at nominal cost, by a number of banks, finance companies, credit unions and the National Family Service Association.Professional counselors make specific recommendations about the percentage of income a family should spend on automobiles. Most of the experts advise that cars should cost no more than 25 per cent of gross income in the year they are purchased.Monthly payments (or the amount), insurance and license fees should be held to 10 per cent of monthly take-home pay. For gas, oil and repairs, costs should not exceed seven to eight per cent of income.That means that a family with a total take-home pay of $1,000 a month should spend about $100 for payments, insurance and license. For a 1972 model used car, insurance and license will cost about $15.50 a month. That leaves $84.50 for monthly payments, under the financial experts' recommendations for the $1,000-a-month family.You probably can purchase a 1972 used car with payments in the $84.50 area if you make a down payment of about $600. Or have a trade-in worth that much.In addition, the 1972 used car would be within the limit of seven to eight per cent of income, or $70 to $80 monthly, for gas, oil and repairs.According to an estimate based on Department of Transportation figures, the cost of gas and oil for driving a standard-size 1972 car 11,500 miles per year is about $36 a month.The calculation is based on the car getting 13.60 miles per gallon at a gas price of 50 cents per gallon.You can adjust your own gas and oil budget up or down, according to your car's miles per gallon, the price of gas in your area, and the number of miles you drive per year.The Department of Transportation estimates that repairs and maintenance, plus replacement of tires would average $22.44 a month.Add that to the estimated $36 and the total for gas, oil and repairs would reach $56.44 per month. Of course, if there's another car in the family, expenses for it, too, have to be figured in the household automotive budget.After you get your second car, keep it in good condition - it will give you better gas mileage and make it more valuable at trade-in time. That helps you stick to a budget that lets you keep two cars in the garage.","1974",0,0

"477","Berkley, Tom",1974-01-23,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Politics. . . politics -- that is, governor's race -- got a flying start. What Butted to be a real . . . in the Republican race for governor has pretty well reduced itself to a one-man show. The announcement by Bob Finch that he will opt out to continue his private law practice -- as opposed to running for the Senate against. Democrat Alan Cranston or the governorship against Ed Reinecke, Houston Flournoy and/or Evelle Younger -- pretty well leaves the field looking like Flournoy, the Controller, will carry the banner for the Republicans. Straws in the wind indicate the choice by big money in the Republican party -- as evidenced by David Packard, who came out last week in support of Flournoy -- putting us in position to make the decision that the big support of the Republican Party will not be with Lieutenant Governor Reinecke. Where Reagan will be in all this, only time will tell. But my guess is that the Republican Party will place its bets on Flournoy as their young wheelhorse, who would have an excellent chance in the race against whichever of the Democratic Party nominees happens to end up as its representative.Democratic Pie a la ModeMoney, the mother's milk of politics, is again playing a big part in the shakedown of the Democratic candidates. Senator George Moscone, a Democrat from San Francisco, has dropped by the wayside. It looks as if Jerome Waldie is going to have money problems before the deal goes down and I would believe that when it gets down to the short strokes the three leading contenders for that race will be Bob Moretti, Mayor Joseph Alioto, and Edmond G. brown Jr. It wouldn't be a bad idea if one of them dropped out, to eliminate as much bloodletting as possible in the Democratic party in the primaries. At this point in time it looks as if the Democrats have the best chance of replacing the good Ronald Reagan, for no matter how it may appear, the Republicans are going to have a tough time overriding Watergate, the fuel shortage, inflation and the fact that they have been in power for the last eight years. We always like a good election year around The POST, for it creates a lot of excitement, gives us something to write about and increases our ad linage as the candidates attempt to woo the constituency of The POST Newspaper.At this writing, Senator Merv Dymally from Los Angeles is covering the state like a blanket in his fight for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor. Merv is a savvy politician and a good guy. He dropped in yesterday to tell me about his campaign and I was impressed. He is picking up support along the way and it looks as though he will be able to make an appreciable showing and must be considered to be a real threat.He had hardly left the office when the lone Chicano who is running for the Lieutenant Governor's office, Fidel Gonzalez, checked in with Hector Reyna, a local Chicano politician. He too is carrying on quite a campaign and spent over an hour with us informing Don Ugarte, editor of El Mundo, our Spanish language paper, what he plans to do, why he is running for office and what his chances are. The two minorities -- that is Senator Dymally, a Black, and Gonzalez, a Chicano -- are running without animosity toward each other and as a matter of fact are willing to share campaigns as they fight for the Black and Latino vote in the state.Statistically it is important, not only from the standpoint of Senator Merv Dymally but of all candidates, that the Chicano population in California approximates three and one-half million and the Black population two million, giving us basically about one fourth of the vote. Obviously, any candidate who is serious has to spend a lot of time in this arena. Added to this, Blacks and Chicanos are the last of the block vote voters, so any money spent in this arena will get more mileage than money spent in the general population.Newspapers have always played an important part in politics and the print media has been and will for a long time be one of the main vehicles used by politicians to get their word across. In the Eastbay -- where The POST Newspaper has a circulation of approximately 100,000 with a combined circulation of the Berkeley, Oakland and Richmond POSTs and the El Mundo Spanish-language paper -- when politics time comes, 630 20th Street in Oakland becomes an important mecca for all candidates.

"480","",1974-01-13,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","When Barbra Streisand sang the words: ""People who need people are the luckiest people in the world"" -- she may not have been thinking of Calvin Owens of Pacoima, Calif. -- but he could well have been the ""music"" to her lyrics.Cal Owens is by any definition of the word - a ""people person."" If Owens had a personal creed, it would read: ""Human relationships are a two-way street of interaction and communication; the person who benefits most out of life is one who absorbs and contributes in equal proportion to his capabilities and general frame of reference.""Simply speaking, Owens loves people and accepts them as they are, seeking to learn from each of them. Owens feels that the greatest source of education in thw world is that which one learns from his contact with other people.In this day and age of tragedies, confrontations, traumas and mistrust, Owens lives in a ""happy"" world -- one, as he puts it, which he enjoys and which gives him satisfaction. It is also one, he adds, that is meaningful and productive.Married and the father of five children. Owens is one of many Americans who works two jobs. In the daytime (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), he serves as a one-man supervisory force at exotic Busch Gardens in Los Angeles and in the evenings (6 p.m. to 10 p.m.), he ""moonlights"" with a ""Special Problems Unit"" of the City of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department.To compound the burden of working in two positions, Owens' jobs are arranged in a way that requries working all seven days of the week. However, Owens has a philosophical outlook, commenting: ""Most people view work as an unpleasant necessity -- I want to enjoy my work and I am fortunate to be in this position.""Owens began working at Busch Gardens in 1966 -- a few weeks before the family entertainment center in the San Fernando Valley opened -- making him one of the oldest employees in point of service. He actually applied for a job with Anheuser-Busch, Inc., in 1960 and was somewhat surprised when they called him six years later to work at the ""new"" Gardens.Busch Gardens is a $13 million tropical complex of lush landscaping, lagoons and waterways filled with 2,000 colorful free-flying birds, plus exotic wildlife and a number of exciting rides and attractions. It has attracted more than 9 million visitors since its inception.When Owens joined the Gardens, it was his ""second"" job to night employment at a local aerospace plant. His first position at Busch Gardens was caretaker for all employee uniforms and part-time tour guide on a monorail that took visitors through the adjacent Anheuser-Busch brewery.Over the years, additional duties were assigned to Owens to the point that he now supervises six different job areas with a combined staff of nearly 50 workers. No end may be in sight but Owens welcomes all new duties as a challenge which must be met.Briefly, Owens' job title would read something like: ""Supervisor of hospitality, security, bartenders, utility, hosts, admissions and guest relations."" One minute he might be taking a picture of a tourist with their camera or serving as an aide to television or motion picture crews as they film at the Gardens.His most ""fond"" recollections involve his duties as a host in the three beverage pavilions at the Gardens.A Black I American, Owens doesn't feel that race has been a major factor in any problems that he has had. Owens feels that his greatest accomplishment during his seven years with the Gardens has been his ability to adapt to situations and retain his composure.Owens commented: ""I feel that I have grown a great deal as a human being because of my involvement with people at Busch Gardens. In many ways, it is like a miniature America' because we have all types of people visiting. My experiences there have helped me adjust better to my private life and improved my outlook on life.""Many of the people under Owens' supervision are in the 18-25 age range and he enjoys working with them very much. ""They keep me young trying to keep up with them at work and they often invite me to their parties, or on water or snow skiing trips,"" he added.Owens' world, is not entirely one of peace, beauty and serenity that surrounds him at Busch Gardens.The evening portion of Owens' present employment also involves youth.As a member of the ""Special Problems Unit"" in the North Pacoima area of Los Angeles, Owens; general function is to work with youngsters in the parks.While his duties at Busch Gardens are interesting, enlightening and very pleasurable, Owens characterizes his role with the City as challenging, demanding, and at times frustrating and satisfying. By the end of a normal working day, Owens has run the gamut of experiences and emotions.For all its bad points, however, Owens believes that ""out of everything bad, something good happens."" He adds: ""There is no greater satisfaction than to watch a kid who started out bad eventually turn around to becoming good.""Owens speaks from personal observation. Born and raised in the ghetto of Kansas City, Kansas, Owens saw many of his childhood friends and neighbors take ""both paths."" After he finished high school. Owens spent eight years in the Air Force -- including service in the Korean War -- and got married, worked and raised a family.What of the future? Eventually, Owens would like to go to college and take classes in accounting, math and business so that he could apply them to his work at Busch Gardens. When his two youngest children finish school in eight years or so, he would like to travel -- when, and if, he could fit it into his schedule.Photo (Among the many employees at Busch Gardens who Calvin Owens supervises are the crowd-pleasing ""Eaglettes"" which assist the Friendly Eagle in welcoming visitors to the scenic complex.)","1974",0,0

At 49, she's the principal of North Elementary School here. She was the first Black school administrator in the area when she was appointed eight years ago.""I work with the most important people in the world - children,"" she says proudly. No ""school marm"" image for her. ""I dress up-to-date and wear pants suits and bright colors. The children like me that way."" Her manner is ""very friendly"" (she makes a point of knowing all of her 350-plus pupils by name) but when necessary, she is firm. (""They know I mean business."")Mrs. James didn't begin her teaching career until she was 31. In Erie, Pennsylvania during the depression years, her parents sacrificed to send their children to college. She remembers their stressing self-reliance (""they thought it was important to take care of ourselves""), yet she entered a career of helping others: social work.Frustration accompanied her first job, running a tuberculosis prevention program in Erie's Black community. ""It was an impossible task to reach many people with the little money and facilities available to us,"" Mrs. James recalls. Moving to Chicago, she found satisfaction as a welfare worker placing children in foster homes.""Many of these youngsters came from very bad situations. Through foster care they were able to go on to a much better life.""Marriage caused Arminta James to move again - this time to Waukegan, Illinois. There she encountered race discrimination in her search for employment. ""I couldn't get a thing."" One social work agency ""wanted me desperately until they found I was Black. They said, 'Well, you understand, we don't need you right away. We'll call'."" That was 20 years ago. Says Mrs. James: ""They haven't called yet.""A teaching offer finally came through, provided Arminta James completed the required education courses. She did, and she took over a fourth grade class at an elementary school in North Chicago. ""I enjoyed working with children. I liked their spontaneity, the way they responded."" Teaching the three ""Rs"" was not difficult, she reports. ""The big challenge was understanding the children and meeting their needs.""The adults were another matter. When Mrs. James became a principal ten years later, she faced opposition from a few. ""People are not always ready to deal with a woman,"" the soft-spoken educator explains, ""and when you compound it by being a Black woman . . . well, you never know if it's your femininity or your color that throws them!""As a mature woman, Mrs. James says she can see where her sex - ""White or Black"" - has been short-changed. Black women have a special problem getting rid of their matriarchal image, she says. ""We want our men to be proud, we must push them forward, without losing our own independence.""That goes for her own family, too. Husband, Walter, is a factory manager. Their 17-year-old nephew, who lives with them, is encouraged to pursue his talents. ""Ted's studying in France on a special program. I'm not bragging,"" she laughs, ""but he's a very, very bright boy.""Arminta James continues her studies, too, aiming to go even higher in school administration. She and her husband plan vaguely for the day when they'll retire, ""but it's a long time away."" For Mrs. James, there are still many moves to be made.","1974",1,0

"483","Berkley, Tom",1974-05-22,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","EMPLOYEES' LICENSE FEEFor some time now, Oakland has been agonizing over how it is going to raise money for its municipal government services. Property owners, both residential and commercial, have had it up their necks in property taxes and take the position that a higher tax rate will drive industry out of the city and make the ownership of commercial property a losing proposition.Suggestions have been made for an across the board increase in all taxes that now generate revenue for the city, together with placing an entertainment tax on activities in the Coliseum. And on the ballot now we have a tax on the transfer of real estate. Obviously the real estate brokers are fighting this, as well as the homeowners.The gravity of the situation rests in the proposition that Oakland is not generating enough money from its tax base to take care of the financial responsibilities of running a city, i.e., paying the salaries of city officials, city employees and the police and fire department, and maintaining the streets and other government owned property that serves those who live within the city as well as those who come in on a daily basis to utilize its facilities.Mayor John H. Reading is suggesting that we place an employment license fee on all people who work in the city -- those who live here and those who commute from outlying areas and thus take advantage of the work opportunities that exist within the city limits. A one-half percent tax on employee salaries in the city would raise approximately $15 million annually and would more than take care of the increasing expense of running the city. Any excess which might be collected over and above what was needed to continue running the city in a proper financial way would give the city administration an opportunity to reduce property taxes and eliminate such inefficient taxes as are presently plaguing the people who live in the city of Oakland.It is easy for The POST Newspapers to support this tax proposition which the mayor is suggesting. The simple facts are that approximately half the people who work in Oakland live outside the city limits and some 75 percent of the better jobs are now held by nonresidents. These persons who live outside the city limits come in daily and use the services of the city without paying anything. Their cars are protected by the police department. Their valuables are supervised and protected by the fire department. Administrative costs of supervising the businesses they work for are handled by the city administration. At the same time they make no financial contributions to these municipal services. In effect, they do as outsiders do in cities all over the United States. Early in the morning they drive into the city, work all day and leave at night, carrying with them their earnings which support the budding communities that ring the center city. This is an inequitable arrangement to those of us who get up in the city in the morning, workthere all day go to bed at night there, and because of our intimate relationship with the city are charged with the responsibility and bear the total burden of the financing of all facets of the city of which we are so much a part.No argument to the contrary really makes sense. It's nice to talk about the free movement of people and the constitutional right for those who live outside to come in and work inside. We hear, too, that suburban dwellers have more efficiency and that the internal city operation and its businesses would be punshed by a great exodus of these workers if they were to be taxed for working in the city. We hear all of this but do not believe it. The city jobs are the inost attractive, they pay the most and the working conditions are the best. Those are the reasons why these outsiders come in and take the jobs. If they could get employment outside the city limits which would be more profitable, obviously they would take it. The vacuum that they would create by quitting for any reason, would be quickly filled up by the 10 percent unemployment that exists within the city limits.The time has come when city dwellers throughout the United States must be pragmatic and chauvinistic about their positions. They must become primarily concerned with the areas in which they live and must insist that those who participate in the fruits of their city share in the responsibility of the financial burden that makes possible the functioning of that city.Of course, there must be some modifications of such a tax, such as possibly not placing this burden upon persons who make less than $5,000 a year. And if the tax generates more money than is needed, adjustments should be made in the other taxes that presently exist. Such a tax must be handled even handedly and those who administer city government must accept the responsibility of running an efficient and economic government.It must be understood, too, that the city has the responsibility of attempting to depress the spiraling rise of inflation. City employees must understand that they cannot live in the fantasy would of automatic annual raises. There is a limit to the productivity of any governmental agency. There comes a time when it is necessary for those who administer city government to make a determination of just what taxes can be generated from those who live within the city. Understanding this limitation those who work for the city must adjust their thinking toward compensation consistent with the city's ability to pay.It is difficult for me to understand the opposition to the mayor's suggested proposal on tax reform as a solution to the financial crisis that faces Oakland I would suspect that those who are crying the loudest are those who work here but live outside the city limits. This is to be expected from them. The common sense of the issue augurs towards the proposition that people who love Oakland will live within its city limits and that those who work there at a minimum be forced to share the burden of the operation of Oakland's central city.Photo (Tom Berkley)","1974",0,1

Snider will use the location to build their fifth warehouse for a San Jose firm, Synergex Hospital Supply Company. The Synergez warehouse, when completed in May, will provide employment for 21 people with an annual payroll of approximately $378,000.00.Tulloch Development Company, based in Oakland since 1933, has purchased a 35,000-square foot site in Oak Center's Industrial Area from the Redevelopment Agency. The new warehouse, to be constructed at 18th and Kirkham Streets, will complement Tulloch's existing 100,000-square-foot facility already operational and filled to capacity. Though there is still leasable space for the new warehouse, the prime tenant will be the Hays Van and Storage Company. Hays is presently located in the Acorn Industrial Area and is moving into the Oak Center Industrial Area due to a need for larger quarters. They employ 25 people with an annual payroll of $250,000.00.In addition, Burke Engineering Company is anticipating a move within the Acorn Industrial Area soon. Their home office is located in Los Angeles with branch offices in Van Nuys, Santa Ana, San Francisco and Oakland. Burkes' Oakland office is presently located on Fourth Street where they have been a tenant since 1970. They have subsequently outgrown their facility, but are so pleased with the area that they have decided to become an owner-occupant at a larger Eighth Street location within Acorn. Construction is planned to start within the next 90 days. Burke Engineering employs 19 people in their Oakland facility with an annual payroll of $300,000.00.""The redevelopment of Oakland's 15-block City Center is an additional positive factor for both Acorn and Oak Center Industrial Areas,"" stated Leslie Moore, Agency Commissioner who functions as project advisor to Acorn.

In a time when 'success formula' plays are the rule, rather than the exception, GRASSROOTS seeks to explore the motives that move the culture, to expose the myths that are misleading and untrue.The current productions ""Real Nigger"" and ""African Shades"" by Cecil Brown are two vastly different approaches to the subject of white and Black America in this particular time.The first play, ""Real Nigger"" could be called a fantasy play in the sense that at is a non-realistic play about the rape of Black culture that occurs after, the dominant society has depleted its creative wellsprings and turns in desperation to ghetto lifestyles and mores.The play is set sometime in the future and follows a real nigger' who has been away in the hills during the urban revolution and returns to find the ghettos deserted by Blacks who have left to join the tredmill with the rest of America; the ghettos are inhabited instead by whites who have rejected their own culture and who can only relate to a stereotype version of the urban subculture.This is a dynamic play where the lines of fantasy and reality become indistinguishable. It challenges its audience to examine the choices available after the turmoil of the sixties.

If you an upset about these flick don't blame the Black . . . appearing in them They are ""just out there tryin' to make a living""Gossett, who co-starred with James Garner in Skin Game and has appeared in several television segments, is now being seen in another movie, The Laughing Policeman, which is not the least bit funny. It is, in fact, a hardhitting story of police work in San Francisco.It is a different kind of role for Gossett, who sees his portrayal in the film as ""a step up."" He plays a police detective who helps solve a mass murder, and is teamed with veteran actors Bruce Dern and Walter Matthau in the actiondrama.The Laughing Policeman is by no means a blaxploitation film. In fact, Gossett is the only major Black character and his role is comparatively small.There has been a veritable flood of Black movies peopled with a wide assortment of dope dealers, pimps, gangsters and seedy characters. Gossett has an opinion of them.""I think these characters definitely have an effect on kids,"" says the actor. ""All you have to do is watch the kids who've seen these films. The movies are placing aspirations in the minds of these kids, . . . of their . . . and thus . . . the ghetto bag . . .Of course, what they . . . realize is that these . . . only exist in . . . the glorified form . . . they're . . . The kids have a . . . sire to grow and . . . than their . . . allows, but the goals they've gleaned from these movies are unattainable. Instead of winding up as heroes or gangsters, they can wind up dead.""Since Gossett admits that such film characterizations influence the actions and goals of young viewers, does he then feel that -- despite loud protestations to the contrary -- these actors owe some consideration to their audiences when they accept roles? Does it become too shallow an answer for an actor to say simply that he ""has to eat"" and thus must accept whatever is offered?Gossett thinks not. He feels an actor's first responsibility is to work -- wherever and whenever possible ""At this particular time in film history Black actors need to work more than anything else. Experience is the only way to grow.""Besides,"" he says, ""the responsibility for film imagery must be extended to the producers who come up with these scripts. They're the ones who come up with these blaxploitation scripts. The blame can't be placed on Black actors because they have to work -- any place and any time the can They have rent to pay, just like everybody else.""Does Gossett object to the advent of athletesturned-actors?""That's a difficult question,"" muses Gossett. ""Of course, anybody should have the right to be able to pursue whatever they want when they're trying to get ahead, especially when they're Black and haven't always had that chance.""But aside from that. I have a professional opinion about performances and I'm pretty sure that Richard Roundtree, who I'm very fond of and who is a good friend, would be the first to admit that the Shaft character would have been that much more dynamite if they had given that part to James Earl Jones or Clarence Williams III.""So I do question the validity of using football players in lead roles.

She attended Black public schools and later enrolled as a business administration major at predominantly Black Florida A&M University.So when Miss Stevens went to Gainesville in 1971 to study for one quarter at the predominantly white University of Florida, she found a whole new experience.""The University of Florida was like a miniature society,"" recalls Miss Stevens now a senior at FAMU. ""As a result of my being there. I was able to see some of the attitudes, the competition, the advantages and disadvantages of society that I otherwise would not have run into until after graduation.""Along with 40 other Black students from FAMU, she attended the University of Florida during the sping quarter of 1971 when a unique and innovative program was initiated between the two schools.It is called the Carnegie Consortium.Sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation it is a cross-cultural exchange program between the two universities that allows FAMU juniors and seniors to experience in-depth contact with whites, and white juniors and seniors from the University of Florida to experience living as a minority group at FAMU.Marva Dennard, Carnegie Consortium director at FAMU, says the program is ""broadening for all participants.""Mrs. Dennard says the program affords FAMU students the chance to ""broaden their educational goals and explore the possibility of graduate and professional study.""The program helps to broaden white University of Florida students by making available to them the opportunity to become ""sensitized"" to Black culture, according to Mrs. Dennard.Most of the University of Florida students who went to the FAMU campus through the Carnegie Consortium were, for the first time in their lives, put into a situation where they were ""the minority.""Douglass Shivers, a Tallahassee native, who was among the University of Florida students who spent the spring quarter of 1972 at FAMU, called the experience invaluable.""It was good for me,"" said Shivers, who entered the Carnegie Program while a University of Florida senior majoring in religion. ""I had never before been in a situation where I was the only white student with a Black teacher and Black classmates.""Shivers, now a graduate student in linguistics at Florida State University, said he ""would recommended the Carnegie Program to other University of Florida students since it offers an experience which they can't get any other way.""Kenneth Johansen, another University of Florida student who spent a quarter at FAMU, expressed similar views. Johansen said the crosscultural exchange program is a ""unique experience which allows the white student to learn about culture and to better sensitize himself to living with Blacks, adding:""It is not unusual for students who sign up for the program to have some fears about going to FAMU.""Johansen said, ""Part of the program's benefit is that the student has the chance to overcome these fears and see they really weren't necessary.""As for FAMU students' reactions to having the white students on campus, Johansen said:""Most of them went out of their way to make sure we had no problems.""Surveys conducted at the end of the Carnegie sessions revealed that the great majority of participants from the University of Florida believed the program had increased their knowledge and awareness of the special needs and problems of minorities.The majority of the students also felt the program had increased their self-confidence about working in a multi-racial situation, along with awakening in them a desire to work more sensitively and more responsibly with Blacks.Dr. Paul B. Mohr, dean of FAMU's School of Education and chairman of the Carnegie Consortium Steering Committee, said the program was introduced by two University of Florida faculty members who based their model on a similar program initiated earlier at Harvard, Yale and Columbia Universities.The program in Florida received a two-year grant, awarded by the Carnegie Foundation to the University of Florida in conjunction with FAMU. Edward Waters College, Bethune-Cookman College, and Florida Memorial College.This grant was used to develop three consortium components -- the pregraduate and pre-professional, the community college transfer and the cross-cultural.According to Dr. Mohr, successes during the first two-year period resulted in refunding of these components and the addition of two new areas -- the transfer and graduate fellowship components.Last year, 25 students from FAMU enrolled in the program while seven entered from the University of Florida. The total number of Carnegie Consortium participants from all five schools was 73.Two FAMU students received full graduate fellowships. This year, four full fellowships will be awarded to FAMU participants.Mrs. Dennard said that 100 students from FAMU and 100 students from the University of Florida are expected to enroll in the spring program and that plans are to expand the program to include freshmen and sophomore students as well as upper-classmen thereby extending the Carnegie Consortium's advantages to a wider range of students.","1974",1,0

It keeps layoffs in a few places or industrices from snowballing into widespread unemployment Thus, it prevents an economic downturn from gathering momentum.""The unemployment insurance program would be even more effective than it is now. Brennan said, if benefit levels were higher.Brennan recalled that in 1060, prior to proposing federal standards. President Nixon asked the states to act voluntartly to raise low benfit ceilings. ""Some states responded to a degree, but many did nothing.""

Non-food commodities rose 5 percent and services 6.2 percent during the year.Many Stations OverchargeWashington -- Ralph B. Short, acting regional commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, told senators at a hearing here conducted last week by Senator John Tunney (D. California) that 43 percent of California's retail petroleum outlets were violating federal price regulations.The most any of the stations had overcharged for gasoline was 6 cents a gallon, said Short. He added:""The investigations which the statistics are based on were as a result of citizens' complaints and other indications of non-compliance with the price regulations.""Short said that those who were not in compliance had ""immediately rolled back prices when contacted by us.""Oroville Is Film LocaleOROVILLE -- Hollywood producer Bill Shiffrin announced last week that a Lee Marvin-Richard Burton movie about today's Ku Klux Klan will be filmed in this Butte County city beginning February 19.The film will be scripted from William Bradford . . . book.

The city council has set aside $550,000 for a municipal loan fund providing low interest loans for owners who are unable to quality for conventional commercial loans.There are some 258 properties in the Pilot Area involved in the program. The Pilot Area is divided into three sections. West Berkeley, San Pablo North and South Berkeley.According to Mayor Warren Widener, ""it is a virtually unique experiment, a partnership among City government, private lenders and residents of the area.""The program is designed to upgrade entire neighborhoods, areas chosen for their likelihood of rehabilitation within the guidelines set for the program which include a maximum individual loan of $10,000 for a single-family dwelling and $15,000 for a multiple dwelling up to four units.A homeowner who lives in one of the areas whose property needs rehabilitating should contact the Pilot Rehabilitation office, at 644-6590, requesting a survey of the property.The property will be checked for code compliance and a determination will be made as to what repairs are needed to make the property safe, or to prevent further deterforation.The Pilot project staff will receive bids on the cost of repairs, and the homeowner will accept the lowest bid. Once the bid has been accepted the homeowner will apply for a loan, either municipal or bankable.If the homeowner can't qualify for a bankable loan, the Municipal Loan Panel will help him secure a loan from the Municipal loan fund.Banks provide loans at current market rates, while the city is using a variable interest rate, from 1 per cent up to the current market interest arate. On the average, these loans are around 5 per cent.Widener said the program is designed to get banks to go back into neighborhoods previously abandoned, and to prove that a voluntary housing conservation programs will work.So far 21 loans have been awarded, 13 city loans amounting to around $95,000 and eight loans through banks amounting to $60,000. All of this has been accomplished in an eight month period.By the end of the fiscal year it is hoped that there will be been a total of 50 loans from the city with an equal amount from private institutions.Widener said approximately two-thirds of Berkeley's housing stock is in rental units, a ratio that has created tremendous demand for rent control.""The rent control Initiative has been voided by lower courts and is on appeal,"" he said. ""There is a limited rent control mechanism working in our Pilot Rehabilitation Project.""According to Widener, landlords using the Municipal loan Fund are prohibited from raising rents more than the actual payback amount plus any tax increases that might occur.At the point when residents want . . ., where financing is available and where there is general movement in upgrading a community, there arises yet another curious result of our preoccupation with newness--the lack of craftsmen capable of doing housing repair and rehabilitation, the mayor said.There is a shortage of carpenters and other trades experienced in the delicate business of tearing out a wall without bringing the whole building down.Berkeley is addressing the problem in their housing program through use of the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (C.E.T.A.) to train young people in this skill.Presently there are six young men and three young women in the construction program and the Mayor hopes to expand it in the future.""If these C.E.T.A. funds are meant for any purpose it is this, to train young people in skills that will have lasting value both to them and all society after their year in C.E.T.A. is completed,"" Widener said Currently C.E.T.A. workers are rehabilitating the Olive Grove Church on Mabel street.These young people under the direction of C.E.T.A. site Director, Edmund T. Lowe Sr., are being taught the art of rehabilitation, with hope they will go forth and make a living in the building trade.Lowe, a long time carperter and contractor has been showing them how to hang sheet-rock, tear out old walls and put in new ones how to build porches so that water won't stand, causing rot and how to shore up sagging beams.Widener said rehabilitation of traditional housing stock will soon assume much more attention that it now receives. ""We are witnessing this trend in our project areas and in the dramatic restoration of the . . . Victorians throughout the Bay Area.""Widener wants to stress that the Pilot Rehabilitation Project is strictly a voluntary program, and the same time encourage homeowners to take advantage of it.The Pilot Project is being watched very carefully by the housing industry Jim Price, Area Director of HUD, said he had a personal enthusiasm for the project. ""Berkeley is one of the few cities to get the program underway,"" he said.Photo (C.E.T.A: ON SITE supervisor, Edmund T. Lowe Sr., explains how they are rebuilding the Olive Baptist Church.

At that time the landlords decided to negotiate with the tenants instead of taking them to court.In 1973 the landlords attempted to renegotiate the leases, because the apartments were being operated below reasonable rental value.Negotiations broke down over responsibility of repairs and the strike continued until now. The trial lasted for seven days with some of the tenants representing themselves, claiming improper upkeep of the apartments and substandard conditions.Judge Robert H. Kroninger granted the combined defense a stay of five days before eviction.

The 1973-1974 season found them ranked 3rd in the nation for Athletic Scholastic Team Competition out of 40,000 teams in the United States and Canada.The 1974 season was also an expansion year. The Oakland Dynamites added a Midget Division in an effort to reach more boys. The program is a competitive cut program. This is necessary because the team does not have the necessary funds to carry all the boys who come out for the teams. With the addition of the Midget Division an additional 40 boys were reached.The total program involved 110 boys and 35 girls last season. Unfortunately, this was a small percentage of the total number of boys and girls who came out for the program. Hopes are to add another Jr. Midget team for the coming season.In the past years 90 per cent of our funding was from parent's support and local advertising in the programs. The 1974 season found the group with little support from parents, largely because 75 per cent of team players are from low-income families. In an effort to continue the program they contacted corporations in the area to enlist their support and thanks to their help were able to make it through the season.The Oakland Dynamite's brand of football teaches much more than how to block, tackle and run. We teach dedication, cooperation, honesty, cleanliness of mind and body, all of which are necessary lessons for life. All players must maintain a C or better to participate on the team.

More important than anything is action.""Indeed, the school is aliteral center of activity. Courses are offered in language arts, math social science, life sciences and environmental studies. Field trips are offered in some classes. For instance, some of the older children will go to the trial of the San Quentin Six.The children also receive instruction in Black History, American History and Labor History. An innovative addition is the teaching of martial arts as well as music, art, drama and dance. Spanish and French are also offered for students who wish to learn a foreign language.The center has an open enrollment. The majority of the children, however, are black and residents of the East Oakland Community.The children are divided into seven groups first by age and then according to their individual levels of growth and development. Groups range from the primary or pre-school group to those on a sixth grade level. The children begin to read at the age of three and a half to four.Where does the funding come from?

Passing the Buckalew Building I heard this voice call Berry Weekes how are you? Turning around I met Mr. Cliff Purvis the doorman of the Buckalew Building for the past 10 years and a resident of Oakland.Berry, Cliff said, a good friend of yours is in town, Mr. Don MacConaugha former general manager of the Golden Gateway Center in San Francisco where I lived for 5 years before moving to Oakland. Asking Cliff. where I could find Donald, I tried his former office and was told he was last seen with Jim Bronkmena, the Executive Director of Embarcadero Center the complex that houses the Embarcadero Hyatt Hotel.So I walked over to the Hyatt Hotel and asked the Executive Secretary to see Mr. Brockmena, and this lady said he was at the Levi Strauss executive office building. By this time it was 4:45 p.m. and the secretary said you better hurry or you might miss him; to this I said you mind phoning there to ask if Mr. MacConaugha is with Mr. Brockmena?While calling the secretary of Mr. Brockmena to see if Mr. MacConaugha was in his office, Mr. MacConaugha was on the other line talking with him. We later got together and talked over old times and the many changes we both have gone through.Atlanta Merchandise MartOne thing we talked about was a new column that will soon start in The Post Newspaper called The Market Pace on ""Interior Decoration."" This will cover all there is to know on carpets, furniture, appliances and how to shop and buy.

After the presentation, questions were in order from the press. The question I asked of Mr. Farbarman was when could they maybe arrange to play a concert with a rock group. To this Mr. Farbarman said this would be great with the Oakland group Tower Of Power.So the conductor of the Oakland Symphony said Berry, if you can get the Tower of Power to compose the music we will be happy to play with them.I can just see this fine outstanding concert being held at Lake Merritt band stand in Lakeside Park free of charge to the public. If not, then maybe they can just receive a donation when people pass the barrel of fun as it's called.Anyway I am trying to reach the Tower of Power to put the deal together very soon for this once-in-a-life-time concert.A New Comic Strip Coming SoonSunday morning while driving across the Golden Gate Bridge I thought why not have some comics in the Post - so, upon arriving at the home of Dan Bonfilgl, I discussed this with him. Dan's a long time artist of the greeting card business and thought this would be a very good idea. So we are tossing around some ideas for the strip. One also for the editorial page.

Last week Mrs. Fran Matarrese, Chairwoman of the East Oakland Housing Committee, announced that the City of Oakland had been selected to participate in a national urban homesteading program sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The goal of this one year pilot program is to rehabilitate and sell to owner occupants vacant homes located in East Oakland. These houses presently owned by the federal government will be turned over to the city for this program.Homesteading is designed to complement other city programs that are aimed a vacant housing problem in East Oakland--a problem that was called a ""crisis"" last spring by the city council. ""Homesteading is one part of our effort to meet this crisis,"" said Mrs. Matarrese. ""It should complement the city's program for abandoned housing funded under the Community Development grant.""Community interest in the homesteading program has been steadily building, noted Mrs. Matarrese. ""For the past month the Committee has been receiving calls daily from prospective buyers. I think people understand that our city is making a concentrated effort to provide decent housing and that the community is solidly behind this effort.""Prospective homesteaders must meet the following minimum requirements: Be the head of household, 18 years or older, who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien; owns no other real property, adjusted family income meets certain maximum limits depending upon family size (e.g., $15,500 for a family of 4), the ability to finance rehabilitation and or the willingness and ability to perform a portion or all of the rehab work.In addition to these requirements, preference will be given to those applicants meeting the financial requirement Preference, in order listed, will be given to those applications meeting the following criteria: lived in Oakland as of January 1, 1975, has a demonstrated need for housing, is a low income family (less than $8000) with ability to perform work or pay for loan; total housing expenses will not exceed 25 percent of adjusted gross family income after rehab is complete; has demonstrated ability to perform portions of the rehab work; has sufficient income to obtain market rate interest loans; are presidents who are employed within Oakland.Applicants should make inquiries at the counseling office of the Oakland Development Agency. Housing counselor, Ms. Henr etta Scott, has announced that three counseling offices will be processing the applications: the main office at 577 14th Street and neighborhood offices at 2316 98th Avenue and 1027 Adeline.According to Senator Allan Cranston's office, Oakland will receive $250,000 for housing and $200,000 for a loan fund.

"524","",1975-05-07,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","ATTORNEY Tom Berkley PUBLISHERMINORITY EMPLOYMENTLast, week employment statistics for the State of California showed an unemployment rate for all of Northern California of 10 per cent - the highest unemployment rate registered in the last 25 years. Oakland reported unemployment at 13 per cent. This doesn't tell the whole story however, for unemployment in the Black community must . . . running close to 20 per cent. Among Black youths between 18 . . . unemployment figure could easily be 30 per cent.Unemployment figures of this magnitude justify the focusing of our attention upon employment as the number one issue facing Oakland presently. The minority population is always hardesthit in any employment crisis. This is old hat and we all know it With a city that has 50 per cent of its population minorities, unemployment figures ranging above 10 per cent cannot be tolerated and it becomes incumbent upon city government, federal agencies and corporations that have the greatest control over employment to do everything within their powers to insist upon the utilization of this labor force.AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMSThe Federal Government sees and understands the importance of the employment of minorities in the work force of America, and is assisting through the activities of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the Justice Department, and the Labor Department to invoke aggressive affirmative action programs designed for permitting and insisting upon the utilization of minority employees.The City of Oakland has an Affirmative Action program, as does the Port of Oakland. The Port of Oakland's program, is probably one of the most far reaching of any government agency's and from the latest report, of the 350 odd employees who work directly for the Port of Oakland, the employment of minorities is in the neighborhood of 42 per cent. This figure does not tell the story of the percentage of minorities employed by the tenants of the port, which by far make up the greatest employment factor in the port activity.Joe Coto, Oakland City Councilman, drew attention to this problem before the Council last week and pointed out that it is not sufficient for Oakland to have the second largest container port a the world unless the activities of this port in its employment pract . . . directly benefit the residents of the city in which it is located - Oakland. This matter will come before the council again this week and though his motion of inquiry died for lack of a second last week, word has it that such sill not be the case the next time it is presented to the Council. The Port of Oakland will be looked at by the City Council to determine if it is living up to its responsibility of developing employment for residents of the city of Oakland not only in its own direct employees, but in the employees of its tenants.As one of the Port Commissioners, I welcome this kind of inquiry. For it would be counterproductive for the most important economic unit in the city to be lax in its effort to make its maximum contribution to the total citizenry.The Mayor has often stated that the economic base of Oakland is its Port and the tenants that occupy its most valuable land. As the Oakland Port grows in national and international prominence, it is only common sense that attention would be focused towards it by the citizens of the city, and questions will be asked that point to its credibility in its effort to resolve the economic problems that the city faces.Along the economic front, Mayor Reading sponsored too, the ordinance that purports to place an employee tax on all the employees of the city of Oakland, with the exception of those who make less than $6,000 per year. This matter is before the Courts and was argued last week. The case is now under submission, testing its validity, and a decision should be forthcoming within the next 30 days. If this employee tax is held to be constitutional by a decision of the Supreme Court, many of Oakland's financial problems will be resolved. For this tax would generate approximately fifteen million dollars a year, and this could correct any inbalance in the city government's budget. Now with the Vietnam crisis behind us and doctors having basically returned to the caring of the sick, it is only natural that the efforts and th energies of the governoent could be addressed to the taking care of its own, the citizens that it governs. Inquiries pointing to and probing into the economic viability of any governmental unit as it relates to the total population are to be encouraged and Joe Colo's inquiry into the ultimate contribution of the Port to the citizens is to be expected.Photo (Tom Berkley)","1975",0,1
"525","Fleming, Thomas C",1975-10-25,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The court fight waged by Blacks under the leadership of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP did not reach a conclusion until long after WWII hostilites ceased, with most of the shipyards being closed down and most of the army of new Black workers in the Bay Area in search of new jobs.At about the same time my attention was turned to the discriminatory hiring practices of the Key System, the large mass transit carrier which spanned Alameda and Contra Costa counties-the forerunner from which grew A-C transit, the present carrier. The Key System was a larger system, since it operated ferries on the bay from Oakland to San Francisco in competition with Southern Pacific.The manpower shortage was acute throughout the Bay Area and despite this very real crisis the Key System refused to hire any Black operators male of female.Both the Market Street Railway and the Municipal Railway had hired hundreds of Blacks. At that time there were three main carriers in San Francisco, the Market Street Railway, which operated trollies, buses and some cable cars. The Municipal Railway, which operated mostly trollies and some buses; and the California Street Railway, which operated only cable cars. The Muni finally bought out the other bankrupt lines under prodding by Roger Lapham, who was elected mayor under a promise that he would end the transit mess.Before getting back to the Key System, I must mention the trials and tribulations of Audley Cole, who took and passed the examination for a motorman, on the Muni.All new motormen then, like now, are sent out with an experienced operator who teaches the neophyte how to operate the iron monsters.The white motormen in San Francisco all refused to go out with Audley Cole, the trainee, with the exception of one man. I don't remember his first name but the last name remains firmly in my mind. Rogers. Rogers went out with the Black trainee, Cole, His defiance of his fellow white workers led to his complete ostracism and many other terrible things which his fellow white workers did to him, including some minor violence; but it was the continual mental harrasement which finally broke Rogers. He took to heavy drinking which ultimately led to his losing his job with the city.Rogers spent a many a day with me at the Reporter office, after losing his job. I grew to love and admire him as a tremendous human being.Now to get back to the Key System and the nightmare of job discrimination in Oakland, which at present probably has the second largest Black population in California.Some civic minded young Blacks in Oakland decided that the Key System was not making any contribution in the nationwide war effort to defeat the axis enemies.The leader and chief spokesman for the group was a man whose surname is Williams, again I forget the first name in the passage of time, but, anyway, he is a brother of Ted Williams, a distinguished bail bond broker in Oakland. Incidentally, the brother whose first name I cannot recall started the bail bond business in Oakland which his brother now operates.Anyway. Williams worked hard among the Black population of Oakland and finally got enough of them brave enough to go to the corporate headquarters of the Key System in a negoitation session that ended in complete disaster; the Key System arrogantly insisted that it did not practice job discrimination as long as the applicants did not show any traces of African ancestry.The Oakland group started sign carrying picket lines and of course. I got the Reporter engaged. I was the editorial staff at that time with Gloria Housen handling the office work and Bob Searcie beating the bushes for advertising.Each week I attended the meetings of the Blacks battling the giant Key System and of course. I joined them on the picket line. The cops were sort of nonplussed at the time, for they had never encourtered Blacks before on economic issues. I think that there were some clashes, but the pickets remained.My stories and my editorials on job discrimination infuriated the Key System enough that I was investigated and my draft board, which was in Emeryville, became interested in me.It was not too long before I was reclassified and became a prime target for service in the armed forces.I was odered to report to the Induction Center February 14, 1945. I passed the physical and a grinning sergeant at the center, which was in San Francisco, told me that I was in the Army. I asked for the Navy, but I had no choice. I along with several other men, was herded on to a bus for Camp Beale, near Marysville.","1975",0,1

Burrell, urged black religious and social leaders gathered to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Montgomery Boycott on Dec. 5 to respond to NBL,s call for the creation of a national coalition to champion the issue of economic parity for minority America.Burrell told the gathering: ""Parity for the people is a concept that touches every phase of human endeavor. Its attainment will provide the necessary resources to effect real community economic development which, in turn, would be reflected in higher income, greater employment, more decent housing, greater accessibility to health care and significant improvement in the nation's productivity growth patterns. Parity is not a culminating objective, but a starting point toward human liberty.""The head of the National Business League, which represents the largest federation of minority business, trade and professional people in the country, warned the gathering that the economic disparity between minority and majority Americans would gain greater momentum unless Black Americans move quickly in the direction of economic determinism. He continued: ""We possess within our own community the necessary human and institutional resources to meet the challenges ahead. If we can bring together the majority of our organization - business civic, religious fraternal, and others - we can attain not only collective and individual justice, but national justice as well.""Concluding his remarks to the assembly, Burrell challenged the Church to join in the struggle for economic parity: ""In all that we do, we must advance and promote the cause of economic parity for our businesses and for our people. To succeed, our community institutions must play a vitally active role in this effort. And the Church, our strongest and most enduring institution, must assume its proper role in the development and implementation of strategies for achieving economic parity. No other challenge is more deserving of its every effort and energy. We urge that great institution to join us as we move forward, upward and onward toward the essential goal of human equality.""The National Business League was founded in 1900 by Booker T. Washington. It is recognized as the nation's foremost national advocate of minority business enterprise and economic development. With 120 local chartered chapters in 37 states and the District of Columbia, and 40 affiliate business, trade and professional organizations, the League is considered the major organizational vehicle for minority businessmen and women in this country.","1975",1,0

"529","Brooks, George",1975-05-21,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","A lack of concern on the part of Black voters, plus the usual disunity, has once again spelled out defeat in the Black community. This time in regards to East Bay politics.In the recent May 13 Oakland City council special election, as well as the previous April 15 Berkeley. Oakland election day, extremely well qualified Black candidates were left in the shadows of victory.In Oakland, a city of an estimated 40-45 per cent Black population, plus 10 to 12 per cent other minorities, as well as in liberal-minded Berkeley-community - dedicated, youthful, energetic, and highly-educated persons of ebony color have been left to ""waste away"" - politically - for, at least, four more years.A lack of unity by the Black candidates themselves, Black leaders, as well as lay people, is a principal reason for Oakland's council chamber and the Board of Education of both Berkeley and Oakland, having a non-increase in Black membership.The second major reason for failure is apathy among Black voters. Not concerned enough to get up off their ""rusty-dusties"" and go to the polls to cast their very much needed ballots.The special Oakland City Council election of May 13 is a prime example of this. Black candidate, Allen Franklin, received only some 16 thousand votes, while his opponent gathered some 21 thousand - enough to win.

Black candidates, vigorously opposing each other, in the April 15 election ... certainly didn't help the Black cause either.If ever, at some point in history. Blacks, Chicanos, Asians, as well as a minimal of liberal whites, could join hands in unity - at the polls - and Black leaders could concentrate more on Black-Minority togetherness, instead of selfish individual power, then perhaps California's powerful Minority populated East Bay area, would be able to rid itself of lesser concerned, ""do nothing for the people"" politicians, and acquire, instead, politicians of great quality ... truly dedicated to the needs and rights of all the people, as so prescribed in the American constitution.FIRST SUBWAYThe nation's first subway line was built in Boston in 1897.

In addition, he recommended that the Mayor and Council appoint all citizens to sit on District Boards and on an advisory commission.OCCUR, in its report, written jointly with the newly formed District Boards in each of the seven flatland areas due to receive the federal monies, recommended that neighborhood, boundaries be established, which would more closely reflect common community interests.OCCUR--Oakland Citizens' Committee for Urban Renewal--has been given the responsibility by the Council to act as a facilitator for citizen involvement in city matters. Over the last 15 months. OCCUR, along with citizen groups, has sponsored more than 50 meetings to find out how citizens want the Community Development Act to be administered in Oakland. At yesterday's worksession, those recommendations were presented to the Council.The Council postponed deciding on OCCUR's recommendation that each district have an independent, small, two-person field staff and that the Community Development Commission be partly made up of representatives chosen by the District Boards.Another work session has been scheduled for 9:00 A.M., Thursday, June 5 so that the Council can put the finishing touches on Community Development organization in Oakland.

There are two exchanges which will permit you to parlay your pennies into plenty of spare change. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. are providing action like you have never seen before. Buying call options offers many investors exactly what they are looking for: A potentially large profit from a relatively small investment. The Options Exchanges provide both the place and the procedures for trading options and fortune hunting.$80,000Options of one kind or another are commonplace in the business world - an example is the option to purchase a house. You put down a deposit to hold the property until a certain date. If you fail to buy or complete the contract, you lose the deposit. However, the price at which you may purchase the property remains the same to you, while it may rise in the market place to other prospective buyers. By the time you have to pay the balance due on the property it can be sold on the open market at a price far above your contracted price. You can sell the property for the higher price, and remit the lower price to the person you bought the option from, pocketing the difference as your profit.Give a man $1,000 for an option to buy a house for $20,000 within a year. If before the year is out you can sell the house to someone else for $25,000 you net 400 per centor $4,000 on your money, after deducting for the cost of the option. On the other hand, if you would have purchased the house right away, paying $20,000 and sold it a year later for $25,000 you would only have made 25 per cent or $5,000. The $20,000 would have brought 20 for a potential profit of $80,000.This gain can be gotten with stocks traded on the options exchanges. The purchase of options involve a high degree of risk and are not suitable for many investors. The big advantage of the call option buyer is that he knows in advance that the most he can lose is the price he has paid for the option.","1975",0,0
"534","Alston, Charlesetta",1975-02-22,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Happy 18th Birthday - over and out! How can it be a Happy Birthday when a non-reader is told at the age of 18 the school no longer has any responsibility for teaching him and therefore he must no longer show up at the classroom. With this I find I have mixed emotions. If he's totally non reading or at such a low level he cannot function, it's just as well he leaves school rather than continue to warm a chair. The next question is what has been the school's responsibility to the student as he sat in the classroom for ten or twelve years? Doesn't the responsibility of the school go beyond the attendance sheet or the age of the student?If a student is five, he's expected to enter kindergarten and do a constant march through the classroom and many times it seems that the teacher's obligation is keeping up with the attendance, making sure the milk money is straight. A lot of possibly important but insignificant chores that have nothing to do with teaching. Each day the teacher prepares and delivers the lesson on the assumption that the student either has had an understood what has gone on previously or is somehow expected to pick it up by osmosis. Barely is anything picked up by osmosis.If it is, it might be a gross distortion of intent. The student may perceive quite differently from the teacher and the teacher automatically thinks the student perceives what she thinks she is transmitting when in fact many times the teacher is transmitting something far different than what is intended. Teachers look at cumulative files that may say a student is retarded or a slow learner and somehow say that's too bad.'I will just teach in my same old way and if the student doesn't get it that's his problem. And this is unfortunate because the problem of non-teaching is the educators' problem. They may not shoulder the responsibility; thus they make it a public problem because if the student doesn't learn well enough in school to survive in our society; society must shoulder the brunt and the responsibilityBecause just by closing our eyes, neither the person nor the problem disappears. Our crime rate soars, our welfare rolls increase and we pay and pay and pay. . . . . . .","1975",0,1

"537","",1975-04-23,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Senator Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) today introduced a ""truth in housing"" bill to protect homebuyers.The measure, Senate Bill 385, imposes new responsibilities on real estate brokers and salesmen selling single-family homes. The broker must obtain information about the house ""material facts"") from the seller and must disclose it to the seller before closing the sale.""Every year the real estate commissioner receives thousands of complaints of misrepresentation and concealment by real estate licensees,"" Petris said.""Despite all educational efforts, many real estate licensees don't believe they have a responsibility to the buyer, or don't care whether the buyer knows what he is getting.""Petris said that hundreds of homes in Oakland have been abandoned by their owners, for a variety of reasons. Among those reasons, he said, are an overestimate of the value of the property and failure to recognize the substantial defects in many older properties. In many cases the precipitating cause is unemployment.""I realize this doesn't deal with the immediate problem of abandoned housing,"" Petris said. ""But I do hope it will help reduce the number of complaints against real estate brokers in the future.Senator Petris is Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs.TRUTH IN HOUSING BILL--BACKGROUNDWhat the bill does. Requires that specified information be obtained from the seller by a broker at the time of entering into a ""listing agreement."" Requires the broker (or salesman) to check with governmental agencies as to zoning, building inspections, assessed value. Requires the broker to provide this information to buyers before they sign any binding contract to buy.Why it is necessary. Most homebuyers find a competent, honest broker and deal with that person. Others either are contacted by a broker or contact the broker who has a listing on a home they are interested in buying. In any case, the buyer's broker really represents the seller and earns his commission by making a sale. If the buyer doesn't ask the right questions, about zoning, assessed value, soil conditions, building inspections and ""bootleg"" improvements, the broker may not volunteer the information. If he does ask, the broker may be unprepared to answer--he had hoped the buyer wouldn't ask. After the sale the buyer has no recourse unless he can prove he relied on the particular condition that was not disclosed to be defective, in deciding to buy. The question arises--if it was so important, why didn't he insist on the answer?How it will work. If a seller has code violations cited against his house, has a foundation or soil subsidence problem, and is using his home for commercial activities not permited in a single-family-zoned-district, yet wants to sell the house for $6000 above the assessed ""full market value,"" he will encounter these obstacles in attempting to sell through a real estate broker:(1) He will be asked if he is aware of any building inspections, and if so, whether violations have been corrected(2) He will be asked to disclose ""any facts which should be disclosed to potential buyers to avoid liability for fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation""(3) The broker will check on the zoning(4) The broker will check on the assessed ""full market value""(5) The broker will check on pending violations not corrected(6) The broker will provide all this information to the buyer in writing(7) The broker will provide I written warning to the buyer that ""there may be defects in he land or improvements.""If the seller has not disclosed, the buyer will have proof of non-disclosure. If the broker mistated, the buyer will have proof of misrepresentation, and the broker may lose his license. If the law is complied with, there may or may not be a sale. If there is a sale, the buyer will not have a basis for complaint as to any defects which have been disclosed.","1975",0,1
"538","",1975-11-09,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","SAN FRANCISCO -- Coping with crime has become a part of the daily routine for the owner of a small business.In 1974. American businesses lost $20.3 billion to criminals, a staggering jump of 31 percent over the 1971 totals, Bank of America says in its latest Small Business Reporter, ""Crime Prevention for Small Businesses."" And these figures represent only the tip of the iceberg -- many crimes go unreported and are not accounted for in any calculations.Small businesses suffer more from criminal losses than do larger ones. ""The small firm,"" the bank says, ""is 35 times as likely to become a victim of crime as the business with receipts of $5 million or more."" According to the Small Business Administration these losses cause 30 to 40 percent of small business failures.Retailing is the hardest hit, the report states. Its losses for 1974 reached $5.8 billion -- 20 percent of the business crime bill for the year. The nature of retailing leaves it wide open to attack from many sides; delivery personnel, con artists and employees by day; burglars robbers and vandals by night.Crime controls accordingto the bank, can be divided into three categories: hardware, management and personnel. The first, the bank explains, includes mechanical and electronic devices to protect premises and merchandise. The second involves management policies for curbing cash and inventory losses. The third demands hiring honest personnel and orienting them to control policies to keep internal and external thefts at a minimum.To the small store, burglary represents the greatest external threat. Last year, the bank reports, burglars absconded with $1.3 billion worth of merchandise. Frightened by these figures, many owners rush to install the latest sophisticated electronic equipment when simple, less expensive systems would do the job as well. Expenses often can be reduced, the report continues, by seeking the advice of experts -- the local police department, alarm company representatives or security cxnsultants.Protection comes in many forms, from watchdogs, guards and protective grills to sensitive electronic systems that establish electromagnetic fields or transmit ultraviolet beams. The burglar triggers the signals which are transmitted to a central monitoring location.Robberies, though accounting for only 3 percent of all business losses, hold real terror for retailers, sometimes resulting in serious injury or even death if a weapon is used. Though experts warn that there is no infallible protection against these threats, certain safeguard can reduce the risk. For example, business owners who make frequent bank deposits reduce their vulnerability. Other merchants use an armored car service for cash pickups. Some use surveillance cameras to protect their premises.The most commonplace crime is shoplifting. In 1974, the report states, an estimated 140 million such incidents depleted merchant's inventories by $1.6 billion. Most of these crimes are perpetrated by amateurs who steal if the opportunity presents itself. Shopowners can protect themselves, the bank says, by learning what to look for Clerks must watch for people with boxes and shopping bags, for price tags that have been switched or for palming -- covering merchandise with a handkerchief or slipping an item into a folded newspaper.Businesses often pay a heavy price for permitting customers to pay for purchases with a check. Last year, bogus checks cost merchants between $1 billion and $2 billion. In-house policies on proper identification must be established and strictly ahered to. Loss prevention methods include check-verification services and devices that mechanically register the customer's fingerprints on the back of the check.Internal theft the report warns accounts for most business crime losses. The Department of Commerce estimates that employees are responsible for up to 80 percent of all retail shortages. To cut down on these figures, the employer's first line of defense is to hire honest employees. Beyond that, the owner can set up a crosscheck system for every key job, maintain cash register controls and keep a tight rein on inventory so that pilferage by employees is less likely and easier to spot.The Small Business Reporter is available at Bank of America offices.","1975",0,1

And to cap things off they let Cazzie Russell, one of the game's greatest shooters, play out his option and go to the hated Los Angeles Lakers.In return for Thurmond they received a center of unknown ability and a fistful of dollars. For the rest they didn't even get a ""thank you"" as Lee left under one of the weirdest transactions in sports and Barnett in the expansion draft.And anybody with an ounce of good sense will say Alvin Attles had to be a genius to think he could build a contender out of one well-traveled superstar, a tortoise guard with bad knees, a tempermental guard and one below the minimum height standard, and a guy who loves snakes. Throw in a center with skeptical hands and a couple of untried-highly-publicized rookies and what did he have left but an 82 game schedule and many trips to the medicine cabinet for the Gelusil.Why, even the expansion team, the New Orleans Jazz, had a brighter future than the Warriors' bleak plans.The guard who was supposed to be slower than molasses got hurt in training camp making the odds against a decent season even less a reality.Warriors' owner Franklin Mieuli brought in a new general manager Dick Vertlieb, but his playing ability was skeptical in case he had to suit up, and new assistant coach Joe Roberts had left his better years at Ohio State.Attles had been friendly with the media throughout his entire career as a player and during his years as a coach, so the media for the most part sympathized with his plight. All of those who had not been antagonized by the anics of the new public relations man, Hal Childs.Sympathy, doesn't win ball games, however. The team needed some points to win games or the 82 games would become a never-ending nightmare. Well, the last game of the regular season will be played this Saturday, at the Oakland Coliseum and the team has played close to .600 ball after 80 games to date.Attles has already been acclaimed Coach of the Year by one periodical and Keith Wilkes, former UCLA All-American has been selected Rookie of the Year.Folks are scratching their heads and pinching themselves. Rick Barry could be voted the most valuable player in the league and then there are the playoffs to come. Could it be the best is yet to come?Who knows what could happen.

"547","",1975-05-10,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The President's chiding of Congress and the people who have reservations about the reception of Vietnamese-refugees, his glowing reference to America's compassion for the homeless who are made the wanderers of the world, are strange words coming from a man who, as minority leader of the House during the past ten years, uttered not a word of compassion for those uncounted thousands of Vietnamese aged, children and newly-made widows who were the horrified recipients of napalm and bombs raining from the sky from U.S. Air Force planes.The grave apprehension shown by governors, mayors and just plain ordinary citizens at the influx of between 150,000 and 200,000 South Vietnamese refugees during this time of economic crisis is easily understandable. America is a nation of immigrants. We absorbed 130,000 Hungarian ""freedom fighters"" and 400,000 to 500,000 Cubans; so 175,000 to 200,000 South Vietnamese is not a large number.True, covert racism probably influences the decision of many loud-mouths. The crucial issue, however, is the fact that thousands of these refugees are admittedly former CIA agents who maintained ""Operation Phoenix,"" one of the most vicious, cut-throat counter-insurgent operations, engaging in murder, torture and maiming, ever described in modern guerrilla warfare. These agents and other adult refugees who worked in the employment of the U.S. military, fled their homeland in fear for their lives, just as many of the refuqees from Hungary and Cuba Unfortunately, these victims of war usually were establishment supporters in their native lands, and they gave lip service as well as action in the battle against indigenous opponents calling themselves national liberation movements, but labeled with the vile word ""Communist"" by the USA and these CIA agents and defeated governmental supporters.Since the majority of these teeming thousands compete for the lowest level of labor, depending upon manual dexterity, racial minorities, particularly Blacks, have felt the brunt of the recent refugee invasions. Blacks have some reservations about those persons welcomed by the white majority as ""defenders of freedom"" in their native lands, who, on residing in America, adopt the most odious forms of the racism which permeates White America; and America's racial minorities soon find themselves with a new enemy whose economic mobility rapidly allows them to replace those least secure citizens, based upon race, in the labor market.We have some reservations about Operation Babylift. Moreover, we have serious reservations about importing into the USA foreign reactionaries who have fought every vestige of social change in their native lands. We need no new enemies in America, in our struggle to develop a more open society in which the instruments of government no longer are weighted in favor of the rich and greedy few, as opposed to the needy and the teeming masses.An insensitive Ford administration, which in combatting inflation is prepared to endure eight to nine-and-one half percent unemployment, puts itself in a precarious position when it asks for half a billion dollars for refugee aid, when heretofore it has given so meagerly of our economic resources for the rehabilitation of millions of unemployed and economically disfranchised, for whom the American Dream becomes daily more blighted. No great crime is committed when generous Americans insist that the plight of the millions of Americans who are homeless, malnourished, under-and non-employed, must be given as high priority as, or higher priority than our concern for those who have done our government's bidding in a cruel civil war in Southeast Asia.Those who control the reins of government are determined to offer refuge and succor to these unfortunate Vietnamese. Let it be so. But let our voices not be silent in our demands that the concerns of America's unfortunates be given just as high priority on the list of governmental assistance and care.","1975",0,1

The Subcommittee, which Congressman Hawkins chairs, will be examining both the executive orders prohibiting discrimination by federal contractors and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits discrimination by both public and private employers and unions.""There has been a federal policy against employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin for more than a decade,"" Congressman Hawkins said, ""yet representation of minorities and women in private industry and in state, local and federal government agencies continues to be disappointingly low.""""The present severe recession,"" he added, ""has practically wiped out the gains of the past few years as minorities and women have borne a disproportionate burden of unemployment At the same time, there is substantial evidence of widespread violations of laws and regulations of all levels of both private and public employment.""The hearings will begin with an overview of federal equal employment policy. The Department of Labor, which through its Office of Federal Contract Compliance, has responsibility for enforcement of Executive Order 11246 prohibiting employment discrimination by federal contractors, will testify in early June, followed by the Civil Service Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.The Department of Labor had been scheduled to testify in earlier Subcommittee hearings held in California in March, but at the Department's request, this appearance was delayed until the new Secretary, John T. Dunlon had an opportunity to review Department policy.""The Subcommittee has had a continuing interest in enforcement of our equal employment laws,"" Congressman Hawkins said, ""Last fall the Subcommittee devoted considerable time looking into the problem of the backlog of charges before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This March, the Subcommittee went to Los Angeles to look at contract compliance operations of the Defense Supply Agency in Southern California.""""Our activities to date,"" he continued, ""have convinced us that we need to review the entire scope of federal activity in this area. How effective have the executive orders and Title VII been in eliminating employment discrimination? What kind of a job have the agencies charged with enforcement of these laws been doing? How much trained labor force is our nation losing because of lack of enforcement of these laws?""President Ford has stated very clearly his position on equal employment opportunity In a recent directive to federal agencies, he stated. 'Our nation's strength is based upon the concept of equal opportunity for all our citizens. Decisions motivated by factors not related to the requirements of a job have no place in the employment system of any employer.' He further stated that non-discrimination and the prohibition of discriminatory practices is not enough. 'What is needed are strong affirmative actions to assure that all persons have an opportunity to compete on a fair and equal basis for employment and advancement...'""I applaud the President's strong and forthright statement. But I am concerned that all too often these policies are not being implemented by the agencies with enforcement responsibility. The questions we must ask are, one, does the individual who has suffered discrimination, or who may so suffer in the future, receive protection and relief from the Federal equal employment opportunity laws; two, are affirmative action policies and programs being implemented to bring about full utilization of women and minorities? Unfortunately, at present this is simply not the case.""Congressman Hawkins indicated that the details of the projected hearings would be announced at a later date.","1975",0,1

Rice is the staple food for over half the world's people.In its ""World Rice Outlook,"" the bank says Mainland China grows and eats about 1/3 of the world's rice But the United States, only the world's 12th largest producer, is the largest exporter.Mainland China grew an extimated 103 million metric tons in 1974. India, the world's second largest producer, grew about 2/3rds as much as China. Other large growers were Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, Thailand, Burma and Brazil.Still, most of these countries are importers of rice, or insignificant exporters. Only about 3 to 5 percent of the world's production ever enters international markets.The United States exports more than a third of its total production -- during 1974 about 1.8 million metric tons of a 5.1 million metric ton harvest. Mainland China, the only other major exporter, shipped about one pecent of its harvest or about 1.4 million metric tons.The study points out that demand for rice has remained strong despite high prices and tight supplies throughout the world. Supplies have been short since a poor growing year in 1972 73, the study says.""The challenge of the rice shortage and high prices will likely cause substantially more acreage to be planted in 1975/76 than in previous years,"" the study says. U. S. government policies, for instance will most likely stimulate new rice plantings and for that reason -- barring poor weather -- record harvests""Price fluctuation is the most prominent feature of the world rice market,"" says the banks report.

Among that group were at least two police informers, Melvin ""Cotton"" Smith and Louis Tackwood. According to Tackwood, part of their mission was to create and further dissention among members of the local Panthers. (The cadre eventually abandoned Jonathan Jackson to face the guns of an alerted police task force alone.)Tackwood said that Newton and Cleaver were victims of this disruptive technique. Apparently, they still are.The Panthers' charges stem basically from the preferential treatment being accorded Cleaver by the FBI. They seem to feel that since Cleaver wasn't gassed, beaten, and thrown into chains, he must, obviously, be a police agent.Far out.If people can't see through a subtrefuge like that, it's small wonder that the Man has been so successful in his attempts to split the Black movement apart. Cutting Cleaver off from any effective support from the Panthers furthers only to weaken the entire struggle.

The so-called housing upswing is quite Illusionary anyway, because April to June housing starts are always higher than at any other time in the year, this year's weak upsurge however, is also the lowest on record for the past 28 years.""Mr. Ford knows full well that housing is still depressed, and that this housing bill would have put more than 800,000 Americans back to work, through its secondary spin-off effect.""But next year is an election year, and the President wants to use his tight control over the Federal Reserve Board in 1976 to loosen up dollar flow, lower interest rates, and thereby temporarily affect an increase in economic production. Some workers might even be able to go to work.""It's going to be the cruelest hoax ever, however, because its gimmick flavor, will not produce any kind of long-range stability for working Americans.""The President's vetoes of the Emergency Housing Act, and the $5.3 billion Emergency Jobs Act, have prevented a minimum of some two million Americans from going back to work.","1975",0,1

Not too impressive now, but it holds the realization of a dream for a small band of men and hope for thousands more.Within a year, a dining room and chapel, built by the 350 members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and staffed by the Brothers of the Good Shepherd and volunteer members of the Society, will serve the poor people of downtown Oakland -- feeding single men, families and the elderly in need.The combination of the society and the brothers is a very special one that portends a dedicated and zealous service to the community.Since St. Vincent de Paul Society began operating its first store in Alameda County 20 years ago, the members hoped to extend their work with the poor to another dimension -- by feeding the hungry. Mike Hester, Ed Moran, Cy Gilfether, Phil Quittman and the late John Morris saw the work of the Brothers in Philadelphia, New Orleans and Albuquerque and realized their generosity and commitment were keys to a successful apostolate.For the Brothers of the Good Shepherd it offered them an extension of their special work. Founded January 19, 1951, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Brother Mathias, B.G.S., who is currently superior general, the congregation promised to ""do the work no one else wanted.""Originally, the brothers served the ""down and outers""--the derelicts, alchoholics, destitute. They extended their mission to the retarded and handicapped. More than a third of their 18 shelters in the United States, Canada, Ireland and United Kingdom care for mentally and physically handicapped children and adults.Here in the Oakland Diocese Brothers Victor Nolan, B.G.S. and John Thomas, B.G.S., are enthusiastic about their new assignment. ""We are appreciative of the gracious reception and support given us by Bishop Begin and are anxious to fulfill our mission of feeding, helping and counseling the people in the area.""The simple motto of the brothers, ""Charity Unlimited"" underscores the quantity and quality of their work. Their community house is a renovated apartment on San Pablo, directly behind the site of the dining room.Brother Victor has worked in hospices in Miami and Philadelphia and was in charge of the dining room in New Orleans for ten years. Brother John has been stationed for four years at Good Shepherd Manor in Momence, Illinois, serving the mentally retarded adults.","1975",1,0

I must say with the power of the Black Press I think many things they talked about will take place if they remove the fan-fare from the convention and deal in reality. I think working within the community along with the Black Newspapers we can improve the center cities, remove the boarded-up look to houses in the cities and obtain more positive productivity within the cities.In the speech by Dr. Berkeley G. Burrel I thought he really made sense when the said we have to work together as one and welcome the whites back to the center cities across the nation with a welcome hand and we can't do it with our fist in the air.We have to join hands socially, economically and with the power of the Black Press like they say we will move mountains and walk on water if we move now and not wait for another convention to rap on rhetoric.","1975",1,0

These works, cast in bronze, terra cotta, plaster or cement, convey a quality of antiquity while portraying the personalities of living human beings. Working directly from the model or his imagination, Washington develops masks which have been described as being reminiscent of a broad range of cultures, including Egyptian, African, Greco Roman, Pre-Columbian and Oceanic Whatever the particular influences or associations, this young black sculptor creates imposing presences of ritualistic power.At age 18, Washington began art studies in New Jersey with traditional sculptor Angelo Fradecus, continued at various schools (Columbus College of Art and Design, San Francisco Art Institute and Sacramento State University), and also travelled in Mexico, Europe and North Africa. At age 28, he rejected an involvement with conceptual art, and returned to his earlier vision of an art concerned with human image, to produce in 1971 the first . . . Mask Series. In 1972, Washington was awarded a commission for a library sculpture in Sacramento. In response to the architectural need for an appropriate scale, the artist created his first larger-than-life masks, which are included in this exhibit.Washington develops the initial sculptural form by working in wet clay. This . . . -dimensional image is then transferred to a plaster or latex mold. Often, before casting, a pattern of semi-precious stones is set into the mold. Preparation of the casting mix includes the selection of contrasting materials and colors for design and emotional value. Upon completion of the cast, the piece is removed from the mold and undergoes further refinement and development. These works are occasionally broken and reassembled, leaving cracks, incomplete features, and fragments, in order to allude to their having an older origin. In addition. Washington grinds, sands and stains certain surfaces developing a subtle patina. Finally, . . . decor such as hanging . . . carved sticks, shells and appropriate materials, including . . . ebony, leather, and gold, silver, or nickel plating are incorporated to complete the work.Photo (Mask above by Horace Washington is one of series by the artist to be exhibited at the Berkeley Art Center September 12-October 12.)","1975",0,0

Most large compaines have technical, financial, and managerial resources for planning their own metric changeover and dealing with it over a long period.The small businessman is less likely to be in a position to decide when to go metric; large companies tend to set the pace. Moreover, the small businessman is more dependent on the ready availability of standard parts and supplies. It is for these reasons that spokesmen for small business favor a coordinated national program, in which no one would be left behind.In a national program the Government would have a special responsibility to ensure that small businesses, including self-employed craftsmen, are properly informed and their interests adequately represented.

Although it was a smash hit at our film festival last October and was also enthusiastically receieved at last year's film festival in Cannes, the film has been the center of controversy and court litigation ever since with Columbia Pictures (original financier of the film) refusing to distribute it. Only a few weeks ago Warner Bros. purchased distribution rights for an undisclosed sum and it is now in its fifth week in Washington, D.C. ""Washington was the most appropriate place to open the film,"" said Schneider at a press luncheon last week, ""because it's where the people involved in setting policy for our country live and are most likely to see it.""""Hearts and Minds"" will have one advance showing this Friday evening under the sponsorship of Senator Alan Cranston and our two Congressmen brothers, Phil lip and John Burton, Congressman Ron Dellums and others. Showing of the film couldn't be more timely in view of President Ford's recent demand for $300 million for Vietnam and only this past Sunday on ABC-TV's ""Issues and Answers,"" Defense Secretary James Schlesinger virtually demanded Congress allocate huge funds for Indochina and predicted (using the same old ""scare"" tactics as used by both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past) that Cambodia will ""absolutely"" fall if we do not allocate those funds. It goes without saying, of course, that Secretary Schlesigner failed to mention our wholly unwarranted (and in this writer's opinion totally immoral) presence in Cambodia in the first place.""Hearts and Minds"" will strengthen the views of anti- Vietnam citizens and hopefully open the eyes of those who hold other or neutral views. The film has to be one of the most moving compassionate yet critical portraits of America ever made. When, for instance, you see and hear the asinine utterances of ex-POW Lt. George Coker when he addresses pre-teenage school children (""Well, if it wasn't for the people, it, Vietnam, was very pretty"") or when you hear Col. George Patton III call his men"".. a bloody good bunch of killers"" or when you hear the equally shocking views expressed by former presidential advisor Walt Rostow (it was Rostow who tried to stop this film's distribution by court action) or General William Westmoreland's sickening words, well, there can be little question but what you will be moved, even be sickened.Schneider stated that in making the film, he and his director Peter Davis addressed themselves to 3 questions: (1) Why we went to Vietnam (2) What we did there and (3) What the doing of those things did to us.""It is a simplification and an understatement for me to merely say that Schneider and Davis (and others involved) have achieved these objectives.

"572","Jordan, Vernon E, Jr",1975-10-19,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT FORDDear Mr. President:I address this Open Letter to you in a spirit of sadness and anticipation. Sadness, because many of your recent statements have served to sabotage the desegregation efforts of the federal courts; anticipation, because I have hopes that your reputation for openness and decency will lead you to adopt a new course that supports school integration.We have had sharp differences over busing in the past, I was among many who raised their voices in protest last year when, at the height of the Boston busing crisis, you made inflammatory statements against busing that helped worsen the tense situation in that city.Now, with several cities, including Louisville and Boston, trying to a dapt to court ordered busing plans, you have again made headlines by criticizing the courts, and expressing opposition to busing.In a recent press conference you charged the courts ""have not taken into consideration"" a law that recommends other approaches to desegregation. At the time you signed that law into effect you said you opposed busing because ""it does not lead to better education and it infringes upon traditional freedoms in America.""These statements, Mr. President; are not only wrong in fact, but they encourage defiance of the courts and severly impede the smooth transition to integrated schools. For example::Many busing plans being implemented this fall were formulated before the passage of the amendment recommending other means of desegregation.: That amendment in no way, impedes busing, it merely suggests other remedies to be used, if possible. One would hope the President of the United States has enough confidence in the federal judiciary to assume that if busing is ordered, it is because it is the best, often the only, means of effecting desegregation in the given situation.: Busing cannot possible be seen as an infringement upon freedoms because it secures the constitutional rights of children. To the extent that busing dismantles segregation it preserves ""traditional freedoms."" The real infringement upon freedom is the system of segregated schooling that perpetuates racial divisions and deprives children of their constitutional rights.: The claim that busing, hence desegregation, ""does not lead to better education"" is highly debatable. Evidenced based on test scores is mixed. But whatever the academic impact, learning to live and work with people of different backgrounds is an essential part of a democratic educational system and to the extent that busing makes this possible, it does ""lead to better education."": I agree with you that quality education can be obtained by improving facilities and lowering teacher-pupil ratios, and strongly urge you to back those statements up with the expanded federal aid to urban school districts that would make this possible. But such improvements should not be presented as an alternative to desegregation; they should not be part of a strategy of ""separate but equal,"" which is illegal and . . . constitutional.. . . President, the issue is not busing and to the degree that . . . the nation's attention on the device of busing, you impede the workings of the law. The real issue is the enfocement of the law, and as a President who has sworm to uphold the laws of the land, I believe you have a positive obligation to cease criticism of court orders and to support the constitutional rights of school children.The highest law of the land states that segregated schools are unconstitutional. The judicial system has responded as the executive branch has not, by ordering desegregation, in some, though not all cases, through busing plans.The President of the United States should place the . . . and power of his office at the services of the courts and do everything possible to support the federal judiciary decisions, to smooth the needless discord that often accompanies desegregation, and to improve the quality of desegregated schools.This Mr. President, is the duty of a national leader, and it is my fervent hope that you will fulfill that crucial role.","1975",1,1

The developers are interested in both residential and commercial growth with little concern for maintaining the ""Neighborhood-like"" atmosphere of the area.Finally after two and one-half hours of hearing public statements from both factions, the Council voted to return the zoning issue back to the Oakland Planning Commission for further study and discussion.The Council also voted to sustain a moratorium on the commercial and residential developments for another 45 days.Just a week before the Council meeting, the Planning Commission unanimously rejected almost all proposals to rezone the Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood. Only the intersection of Piedmont and Pleasant Valley Avenues had been left open for the Council's decision.However, Mayor John Reading and the Council voted to send the entire rezoning issue back to the Planning Commission.Planning Commission Chairperson, Marjory Gibson, initiated the proposal to send the rezoning issue of Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood back to the Commission for further analysis.

He explained that for more than a year 60 to 100 people have worked to downzone the area.The opoosing faction, representing the business and real estate interests, was Michael Grappo, head of Save Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood (SPAN).PANIL favors a downzoning of the Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood bounded by Pleasant Valley Ave., Broadway, MacArthur Blvd and the Piedmont-Oakland border.They want to rezone the area from a C-30 to a C-31. The C-31 zone would restrict the commercial development to ""pedestrian-oriented"" businesses, restrict the use of signs and eliminate bill boards. Also the C-31 zone would require that new plans for commercial development be reviewed for design by the Planning Commission.PANIL also wants to rezone the residential status of Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood to protect the area from highrise apartment structures.""These highrises provide a canyon-like effect on the neighboring single family homes in the area."" Talley said.PANIL spokesperson, Talley, also argues, ""Without the downzoning, the charming, small town atmosphere of the neighborhood would be destroyed. This type of residential area, one of the few still remaining in the city, provides a place for middle class people in Oakland.""One of the main issues at present concerns the building of a 7-11 all-night market. PANIL protested the opening of another all-night store in their neighborhood. They said that it will bring down the neighborhood and invite crime into the area.Grappo, an attorney and former resident of the Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood, has business developments in the area.He argues that PANIL's proposals to downzone the neighborhood will create a housing shortage and cut down on the city's potentially increased revenue from a more development commercial and residential area.Grappo reminded the Council that Oakland's master plan encourages medium and high density zoning around shopping areas. This proposed downzoning contradicts such goals, he vehemently argues.","1975",0,1

"581","Jordan, Vernon E, Jr",1976-01-14,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","A couple of months ago I was invited to Ohio State University's Annual Visitation Day, a three-day expense-paid program to recruit Black students for graduate study. The University invites high ranking students from Black colleges to come to the Ohio State campus at Columbus, look the school over and consider going to graduate school there.The young scholars get to talk to professors, students, and advisors, and get information about scholarship aid, grants, assistantships, and other facts they need to make an informed decision about whether to go to graduate school and which one to select.Some 250 Black students from 53 predominately Black colleges were at the Visitation Day program when I was there and if past experience is a guide, nearly 200 will wind up at Ohio State, most of them with fellowships. There are now 225 Blacks on fellowships at the Graduate School, compared with only 12 four years ago.The program was a brainchild of Dean Frank W. Hale, Jr. and, with other special efforts including scholarship aid, fellowships, and other forms of assistance, has enabled the university to compile a respectable record in producing Black graduates.Thus, it is no accident that Ohio State has graduated more Blacks PhDs than any other predominately white university in the country. Under Dean Hale's leadership, it understands the need for active recruitment of Black students, the desirability . . . overcoming natural suspicious through on-the-spot . . . and the absolute need for the availability for fellowship aid to students drawn from the poorest segment of our society.This program is the kind that ought to be emulated by other top universities. Most just make a pass at recruitment, waiting for Blacks to apply without any particular encouragement. This combined with shrinking availability of scholarship funds, inevitably means continuation of the historic exclusion of Blacks from graduate training.It will take special efforts to overcome that exclusion, efforts that are desperately needed. Only about three percent of higher paying jobs are held by Blacks, and in almost any of the high status, high pay professions -- law, medicine, engineering, etc. -- Blacks form one to two percent of the total.Graduate education is the key to access to those jobs and professions. In our overcredentialized society, employers are demanding MAs and PhDs for jobs they used to hire college graduates for, and sometimes even for positions that didn't even demand the BA.It's the same old story, just as Blacks are getting to the starting gate, entrance becomes more restricted. Black college attendance, although still unfairly low is beginning to approach the Black population share, but the dropout rate is far higher than for whites and Blacks are grossly underrepresented in graduate and professional schools, even, I should add, at . . . State, despite the excellence of its visitation days.Part of the key to increasing minority access to higher education, including vocational education, lies in providing the financial assistance to enable youngsters to concentrate on their studies.That's why another program I've learned of, called Cleveland Scholarship Programs, is so interesting. This program wisely starts in the high schools, providing counseling and assistance in helping students apply for a college and continues on through various forms of aid through college, vocational training or technical school.The stress on technical training is especially useful since most federal and state programs seem to think that youngsters only need scholarship aid while in college, leaving those who seek advanced technical or vocational training out in the cold.Programs like the Ohio State visitations, Cleveland Scholarships (nearly half of this program's participants are white by the way), those run by the Urban League and other community-based institutions, are like beacons shining in the dark night of neglect.In some small way they help increase minority access to the tools for a better life and help to open up an educational structure in danger of strangling itself in exclusiveness.","1976",1,0
"582","",1976-05-02,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Cases challenging the constitutionality of traditional hiring and firing practices have been coming before the courts lately as minorities and women try to reverse the old last hired, first fired system.Companies arenow having to deal with the dilemma of providing both job security and equal opportunity for employes.Three researchers have suggested that one solution to the problem is to turn the seniority system upside down. Robert T. Lund. Dennis C. Bumstead and Sheldon Friedman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested the plan and tried it out on an agricultural implements firmUnder such a plan, senior high-ranking workers who probably can best survive the financial hard times could elect to be laid off first -- but temporarily and with some compensation. Newly hired workers who may be ill-prepared to ride out a recession would be retained on the job.Use of the plan virtually exhausted the company's funds for supplementary unemployment benefits, and state employment security authorities balked at having to pay unemployment checks to employable skilled workers.But the program survived, and a modified form of it is not widely adopted in the agricultural and construction equipment industries.The leaves at the top are optional, limited to 13-week periods and the company pays all benefits Employees on the job less than a year are laid off first.Compensation, say the researchers, would have to be great enough to induce high-seniority workers to take this option, which could then be looked upon as a privilege earned by lengthy service.Benefits to society-at-large would include reduction in welfare payments, possibly making the system worthy of federal support, the researchers believe.","1976",0,1
"583","",1976-09-23,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The 6 to 1 decision by the California Supreme Court In the case of Bakke vs. University of California Medical School, Davis, declared unconstitutional the preferential selection of minority students; this landmark decision threatens to destroy all efforts of the University of California system, the California State University system and private institutions of higher learning to develop a meaningful program to end de facto segregation of racial minorities and women in all higher education and professional schools.When the preferential selection was instituted approximately ten years ago, the number of racial minorities and women in the schools of medicine and dentistry operated by the University of California System was less than 7 percent women and 5 percent racial minorities. In 1966 and '67, the University of California came under pressure from the Federal EEOC and HEW; Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited racial and sexual discrimination in all institutions receiving federal aid. The University of California had been accused of racism in the composition of student body, appointment of faculty members and hiring of administrative personnel.Shortly afterward the complaint was enlarged to include university discrimination based upon sex.The argument that the affirmative action program in higher education which provides for the admission of minority applicants to professional schools is unconstitutional, since it discriminates against the majority, represents another instance in which the/scales of justice in a racist society always penalizes racial minorities, who always find themselves faced with the responsibility of climbing the lofty peaks of equal opportunity with heavy burdens attached not only to their backs but also to their legs.This California Supreme Court decision represents another victory for the reactionary forces attempting to turn back the clock on the determined efforts of women and racial minorities to secure equal opportunities under law. While the California Supreme Court challenges preferential admission standards for minority applicants and thinks of them as a ""quota system"" by another name, the Federal District Courts, apparently, are cognizant of the fact that if equal opportunity is to become a reality, persons long discriminated against must be provided for in the educational equation, so that discriminatory conditions are relieved immediately; moreover, programs must be instituted to overcome the disadvantage long suffered because of racial discriminatory admission policies of state-supported universities, professional schools and colleges.Justice Stanley Mosk reasoned my opically: ""It is not necessary to discriminate against white applicants in order to achieve the university's objectives of integrating the student body and improving medical care for minorities."" Yet, a Federal Court Judge in San Francisco ruled that in both the Police and Fire Departments for the next five years 3 of every 5 personnel hired must be racial minority persons.We live in a quantitative society. The nation requires military service based upon the proportionate representation of racial minorities in the population. In fact, in Vietnam 22 and 20% of the casulaties of infantry soldiers were Blacks and Chicanos, respectively. If a quantitative measure is not provided in the form of fixed numbers or percentages in the removal of inequities, what proposal do the court and those persons opposed to quotas suggest to end the nightmare of continued racial discrimination in the education of racial and ethnic minorities in medicine dentistry and law.In 1974 the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule upon this question when the case of a while student who had sued to gain admission to the University of Washington came before it. The university law school has allowed the student to study law and graduate before his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court; therefore the court ruled the case was moot by a 5 to 4 vote, and decided not to hear it. The U.S. Supreme Court will not be able to escape ruling on the crucial Bakke vs. UC Davis case.Irrespective of Judge Stanley Mosk's majority opinion, racial discrimination has existed over decades and continues to exist in the UC Medical Schools as well as the University, itself. If the California Supreme Court majority should propose a plan for achieving the objectives of the now declared unconstitutional preferential admissions procedure, an invaluable service would be rendered.We urged Black parents and students to bring legal action in the federal courts to compel the University of California to initiate a policy of admissions in all of its schools prohibiting its present racial and sexual discrimination. Since the preferential admissions program is overturned, what admissions procedures will the University use? Maybe all of the professional schools should be closed until this grave problem is adjudicated. Why should the Blacks of California, or for that matter the women of California, continue to support an exclusive university professional school system which obviously now offers no protection to those disadvantaged persons who are victimized daily by a cruel society which is both racist and sexist?","1976",0,1

Foreman, once called the most devastating hitter the division had seen, wants to prove poor preparation led to his defeat not the intelligence of Ali.Smoking Joe hopes to remove the nightmare that has followed since that warm February night in the tropical island when he and his camp were astonished by a lightly regarded challenger from Hayward, Foreman.Frazier must remember how he had hardly started the evening's activities when a vicious Foreman right hand sent him to the canvas.A more cautious battler may have back pedalled to weather the storm but the singleminded Frazier continued to press forward only to be pummelled to the floor by Foreman's heavy artillery.Time can't erase the humiliation Frazier felt after hitting the deck seven times before the hostilities were halted.In his preparations for the bout Frazier is adding retreating and sliding to his fistic repretoire in hope of confusing Foreman.The same maneuvers were practiced before the last Ali-Frazier encounter--the Thrilla in Manila--but in the end it was the same old Smoking Joe, shuffling forward and absorbing blows like a sponge, that called it quits after 14 rounds.Foreman's camp knows Frazier can't adopt a new style overnight so they have cautioned their man not to use up all of his strength trying for an early knockout.

No, I'm not crazy nor are the three musicians I interviewed on Thursday at the Hyatt on Unton Square in San Francisco. When the call first came from New York about the three young musicians, Billy Gibbon, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard--that make up the 'ZZ Top' group--I thought the young lady was putting me on. She asked, ""Have you heard of Z Z Top?"" to which I said 'Who! No, I haven't.' The young lady, Leona Faber, said, ""you haven't!"" I said, No. After going around, she proceeded to tell me about this outstanding group coming to San Francisco. She started by telling me they were bringing two Buzzards, a Long horn, Buffalo, Jabalina (wild Boar) and two rattlers. I said ""Stop there, rattlers are not my bag."" She soon enlightened me...they were enclosed in bullet-proof glass. Now all these wild animals are on stage as the 'Z Z Top' group are playing. But have no fear - they are well trained. (One time though, the three, Billy, Dusty and Frank, said someone burst balloons or a fire-cracker around the two buzzards. They spread their eight-foot wings and flew over the ducking, dodging, music lovers. They assured me this ""will not happen this time,"" - as I sat there laughing.)MAKING A WORLD-WIDE TEXAS TOUR...It started with great crowd reaction, like 65,000 in Pittsburgh; 20,000 in San . . . 50,000 in Los Angeles (Anaheim), and now San Francisco's Cow Palace. With all those animals they are in the right place. Trying to put in a little humor while interviewing the 'Z Z Top' fun fellows, I asked what fun event or disaster can you remember from the time when you first started out in showbiz. Well it seems once they were playing for some event in Alvin, Texas, a very small town. They prepared behind the curtains at the National Guard Armory. The roll of the drums, guitars, the curtains opened and wham! only one, yes-one, 14 year old boy was in the auditorium. So what did Frank, Rusty and Billy do? They played four sets for their only customer. . . . that...they told me they bought him a coke, and why hot, he was the only paying customer in the joint. So it all proves the show must go on, from one fourteen-year-old boy to 65,000 fans in a short span of six years.LA GRANGE, TOTAL POPULATION 3920...This little town had what you would call a famous Bordello when some smart Houston, Texas, newspaper man destroyed the famous landmark, so the three - Billy, Frank and Dusty - made a song about the famous little town and the very famous Bordello, called La Grange. It is, would you believe, a best seller, I wonder why. Other tunes now Gold and Platinum are, 'Master of the Sparks' 'Tres Hombres' and 'Fandango,' and 'ZZ Tops' first album, 'Rio Grande Mud.''Master of The Sparks' came about when they were kids, they would put a chair in a steel wire ball, sit on the back of a truck going about 40 to 50 miles an hour, roll the ball off and watch the sparks bounce off with them inside. Needless to say it almost killed them time after time, so you can see you are in for some crazy goings-on at the Cow Palace.NOW INTO MUSIC, WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT...Their stage show features an entire back drop of a wild west desert scene--5th Dimension, complete on stage with rattlesnakes and other wild animals. They are traveling with their own veterinarian. To prove they are down-home Texans (and they are, I will vouch for that), they also make fantastic music about the great state of Texas. When they have completed the tour, they will have traveled from Atlanta. Pittsburg, Winston-Salem. North Carolina, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Europe, Japan, Australia and Mexico--to name a few. The entire show tours will be 25 shows, with sixteen months to go. To tell of the extent of the production, although there are only three members in the singing group, 40 people involved with the 'ZZ TOP' Group. They also told me it takes 11,000 man hours to assemble the stage and sound equipment. This is all carried around in nine-semis. In closing, I can say I've met many traveling musicians, although what they are playing is not my style, this I will have to hear. One thing I can say about Billy Gibbon, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard, they are homey Boys. I really felt like I was right at home, even with them being very successful. I think and felt they still remember where they came from and wear the same size cowboy hat now that they wore six years ago.

In addition, Dr. Mary Woods Bennett, professor emeritus of psychology and child development, will give her reflections on the school's history.The school began its first session with 20 students in the recreation room of Olney residence hall. Today it enrolls 59 children and since 1966 has been housed in its present permanent location in the beautifully remodeled Norman Bridge Health Center.Throughout its history, the School has been involved with many community programs related to young children. In the late 1920's it was host to two significant regional conferences at which persons concerned with early education established the Pacific Coast Nursery School Association.During the depression years of the 1930's, the School offered special courses for teachers in WPA nursery schools and in schools which were established in migrant camps and housing projects.In World War II, under a grant from the Rosenberg Foundate, it presented an inservice training program for directors of wartime Child Care Centers.Many workshops, seminars, and lectures are offered each year for nursery school teachers and directors from throughout the Bay Area and California.","1976",0,0

The Herrick-Berkeley Community Methadone Program began in 1971 and was the first methadone treatment program in the East Bay. This spring it was judged the best of four such programs in Alameda County by the County's office of Program Evaluation. Fees at the program center are based on the patient's ability to pay.Clarence Roundtree could have been long dead by now.Snuffed out alone behind some locked door by heroin, the evil opiate that lures you to non away your troubles and in the process takes over your life.But Clarence Roundtree is a determined young man. So two years ago when he was . . . another chance to pull himself out of his nightmare, he knew held better grab at.The methadone program . . . last chance. I'd tried everything else. There was . . . else to turn, says Clarence who has been drugtree for more than a year.""If I'd have gone back out on the streets, running and ripping I would have ended up back in . . . or would have . . . for good. Now I don't use drugs I don't smoke . . . make me a . . . for something. I just want to live.With a little help from his friends Clarence has carved out a new life for himself. He is working hard. He is a family man. For the first time in many years, he had control over his life no longer needing drugs a an escape from his painful past. A past that is probably not unlike the pasts of many other drug users.Clarence was born in 1941 in a small Virginia town and was raised by his elderly grand mother.I grew up with no dad. I never met him. Don't even know his name,"" he says. ""My mother was gone a lot. She was so distant, I couldn't even relate to her. To me, she was Louise. I didn't even call her mother!""Right from the beginning Clarence was his own keeper.There was no one there to left me what, to do. No one to help when I needed guidance,"" he said.He dropped out of school when he was 15. ""I didn't have anything against school. But I didn't have anyone to lead me, to tell me what school was all about,"" he says. ""I didn't have the proper clothes to wear. The other kids were all neat, and I had to come to school with the same old pants and holes in my shoes. I only played hooky once, until I just quit going.At age 20. Clarence found himself married and the father of a baby girl. He got a job as second cook in an Italian restaurant to support his new family.""It was a marriage that I should never have gotten int,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Mom was nowhere around to tell me no. I'm not blaming it all on her, but she was never there at those times when I needed her most.""When he was 21, Clarence had his first drug experience. And he hated it.""I remember it well. Two friends. Clarence and Fred, took me to a house on a busy street. They went into the bathroom and were shooting up heroin). They told me I'd like it. So I tried it I got sick to my stomach and threw up.""Clarence did not touch drugs again for six or eight months.""I started hustling stealing with these guys They were spending all their money on dope. I didn't have anything to spend my extra money on so ended up giving it to them, he says.""I wanted to find out what they got out of heroin that was worth blowing all their money on. I was fascinated with watching them sitting in the corner and nodding. So I tried it again.""After going through the initial sickness. Clarence was enveloped by the euphoria the drug produced. Heroin was plentiful in his small town, so he became a regular user. He lost his job and survived by stealing money and merchandise from stores.Drugs give you a feeling of security. They give you a good feeling so you can block out all your troubles. Heroin did cover up my problems for a certain length of time. But then, after a while you just keep shooting, desperately trying to escape. But you can't. You have to live with yourself,"" says Clarence, looking back on his former lifestyle. A lifestyle which landed him in jail for months or years at a stretch.Clarence went to jail for the first time in the early 1960s for theft. By then an addict, he went ""cold turkey"" in his jail cell.""I never saw a doctor Dope fiends didn't go to the hospital unless they (the jailers), through they were going to die,"" he says. ""People in the jail told me to take a shower when I really started feeling bad When you go cold turkey, you want to relax, Keep yourself still. Keep covers on Double up by yourself in the corner and keep on heaving. The showers helped, and so did the regular meals. After seven or eight days I felt like a person again instead of a wet dish-towel.""But this detoxification seemed all in vain, for Clarence soon discovered that it was not impossible to continue to be a junkie while in prison.""My old lady would, buy a couple bags of heroin and bring it with her when she came to visit Or, one of the other guys would get some and share it,"" he says.When he finally was sentenced to two years at a road camp, heroin was in short supply. So prisoners who were into drugs improvised by injecting the contents of nasal inhalers into their veins.When he was released from prison. Clarence found that his wife had begun using drugs too.""I tried to find a job so I could start taking care of my family I couldn't find one. I started hustling again,"" he said.Once in motion the vicious circle kept right on spinning.Soon, Clarence was arrested again, but escaped, while waiting to go before the judge. He and his wife made their way to New York City and the safety of her mother's home.""For a while, I didn't get into anything in New York because I didn't know anyone there,"" Clarence says. ""I got a job washing dishes and wasn't asing drugs. My old lady wasn't either. But when we got a little money in our pockets, we'd get some junk and shoot up...It's like a disease. Every day, every day, you have to have something to keep you moving. To make you feel good, not realizing there has to be bad feelings once in a while.This time when he ran out of money. Clarence sought help at one of New York City's large drug rehabilitation programs. He stayed clean as long as he was on the program. But when he quit going, he found himself back on the same old merry goround.""We went back and forth to several hospitals and programs trying to kick it and stay off,"" he says. ""My old lady she really, didn't want the help that I wanted. The last time I took her to the hospital she was in really bad shape and was . . . trying to kill myself with drugs.""When there's no money to buy dope, there's desperation. The third time Clarence broke into a pusher's . . . some cocaine, he had a real surprise waiting for his.""The guy came in with a pistol,"" he says. I was lucky I didn't get wasted. He was really close Either he wasn't trying to kill me or be just didn't know flow in use the pistol.""A bullet pierved Clarence a shoulder and another tore into his foot. He made his getaway out the third flour window onto the fire escape, but in the process broke his other atikle He was hospitalized for three weeks.""At the hospital they knew I used drugs but that's not what I was there for so there was nothing they could do about it,"" says Clarence. ""I was always asking for pain medicine and I didn't have any trouble getting it.""He was released with casts on both lets and no money in his pockets.""I went on welfare and was shooting drugs the same day,"" he says. ""It never did dawn on me that my life had nearly been taken. When you use drugs, you don't think about life or death ""You're just in terested in feeling good.""By this time his wife had left with another man. And Clarence for drugs get an even lighter hold on what he had left of his life.""I tell out coverdosed quite a few tunes but was lucky"" he says. I'd just lock the door . . . I'd come out of it. I . . . anything for anybody just got worse and worse and worse.Then or the subway he met the woman who was to become his second wife.I was in bad shape and she nursed me back to health for eight months. I got myself straight started working again -- and then. I went to New York City and got loaded Once she had me arrested. The only way I could keep from going to jail was to go to another rehabilitation program called Damon House.""Clarence said that Damon House was a residential treatment program much like Synanon a good strict program."" He feit good about himself while he was there and says he got a lot out of group therapy.""It made me more aware of myself. Things that, I didn't want to talk about. I would talk about with others who were in the same condition,"" he says. ""This is what it's all about. Getting down to your gut-level feelings. I've learned that worry is bad for the stomach. Why worry about something you can't change or something that is going to take care of itself?""Clarence stayed at Damon House for two years and left with his framed certificate that proclaimed he'd been off drugs for that long.""We were all given the goahead sign to go out there and do the best for ourselves,"" he says. ""A lot of people made it. Others went out and began shooting again.""Then, he and his wife moved to California to get what they thought would be a fresh start.""When I left Damon House, they told me I should keep in touch with some sort of therapy program. But I thought I was all right. I was really concerned with getting . . . job,"" he says, realizing now that he made made a big mistake.Charence found work. But he also found a new circle of friends who were into the drug scene. He started smoking pot again, then eased into snorting cocaine and shooting speed. It was a short step back to heroin.Fortunately for Clarence, his wife was very supportive. She had heard about the Herrick-Berkeley Community Methadone Program and steered him here for help.""I was getting old and had finally come to the realization that I was either going to get myself straight ot kill myself with drugs,"" he says. ""I felt little I couldn't drop my card this time.""Although he'd always refused replacing heroin with other drugs to help him kick the habit, he decided that it was time to give methadone a chance. While still addictive, methadone is a pure synthetic opiate that is administered orally in carefully measured doses. It keeps the addict from getting sick from withdrawal, but does not produce a ""high"" or euphoric effect. The patient's methadone dosage is gradually decreased until, ideally, he no longer needs it at all. This takes anywhere from six months to two years, depending on the individual's motivation and physical needs.""Clarence was really ready for the program,"" recalls Walter Byrd, is director. ""Methadone helps an addict suppress the craving for other opiates, but it won't do it all. Desine has a lot to do with it. And Clarence had the desire.""Once Clarence's methadone dosage was adjusted, he says, he felt fine.""Methadone made me feel like I was normal,"" he says. ""I didn't think about using drugs. It gave me time to look at myself, and to look at others who were still using drugs and those who have made it, like Walter. It gave me time to do things on my own without feeling sick or high, and it kept me from stealing and going back to jail.""Different programs work for different people. Methadone was my final chance, and thank God I got that chance. I began thinking, 'hey, you can do anything you want.'""Clarence gave himself completely to individual and group therapy sessions -- the ""medicine of the mind"" that is perhaps the most important aspect of any drug treatment program. Each person is accepted here, and each understands what the other is going through, so it is much easier to be honest and face the truth about one's problems.""Clarence is not afraid to open up and be receptive. Those are the people who are most successful with the program,"" says Byrd. ""I think his previous treatment attempts helped.""After eight months Clarence no longer needed methadone, and he has been completely drug-free for more than a year. But he keeps in touch, and still shows up at group therapy sessions about once a month.""I'm not going to make the same mistake again,"" he says. ""You really have to work hard at staying straight. I've seen people fall who have been clean for four or five years. I'm not going to let it happen to me.""Clarence says he has no desire to use drugs again and credits Byrd with much of his success.""I really look up to Walter because he's been through it too and nothing is going to change his mind. He's free, free, free. He knows what he wants out of life.""I've known a lot of people in drug rehab programs. With most of them, it's a 9 to 5 job. But Walter -- he helps people all the time. It must take a lot out of him, but puts a lot into him, too, because he knows he's really helping people.""For the past year, Clarence has been piecing his life together. He has a new woman, one who has never used drugs.""Finally. I've got a woman with a good head,"" he says of his Geneva. ""She gives me a lot of my strength. I know I won't shoot dope again!""Clarence and Geneva are the managers of a fast-food restaurant. They live in Berkeley with Geneva's three children.""When I get off work, I made a bee line home,"" he says, ""I want to be around Geneva and the kids most of the time.""Clarence is sorry that he never finished high school but what he . . . in formal education he makes up with common sense and motivation. Righ now he has one ambition.""I'd like to own that store I'm working in and someday have my name up there on the sign. That's what I'm working for I want to leave my name so it's here after Em gone, I want to be . . . as a hard working wrong mant.""Flarence says the . . . look back only . . . But all too frequently . . . of where he used to be.I see kids come into the restairant and I know they're using drugs he says ""I try to left them . . . that's no good Kye been there and I know. But it's like talking to a brick wall. Once they reach that stage they won't . . . They'll either learn for themselves like I did or get shot or kill themselves with the stuff.""I'm not ashamed if people know I used to use drugs.

"593","",1976-04-17,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Editor's Note: The following is the text of a letter sent to President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, President of the National Newspaper Publishers Association-The Black Press of America and Publisher of the Sun-Reporter.Mr. President:This letter comes to state the position of the Black Press of America(the voice of 25 million Black Americans--more numerous than the populations of 154 other nations in the world) on Secretary of State Henry R. Kissinger's statement of U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis Cuba's military assistance to the national liberation movements in Black Africa. Apparently saber rattling has become an initial step in Secretary Kissinger's foreign policy armarium.Our criticism of the Kissinger-Ford Doctrine on national liberation movements in Africa concerns three countries.1. Namibia (Southwest Africa)For more than fifty years since the founding of the League of Nations, the U.S. Government has been on a treadmill of platitudinous opposition to the racist policies of the government of South Africa and the Southwest territories which were expropriated from Germany by the victors of World War I. During these fifty years the multinational corporations and the White South Africans have robbed the people of the Southwest territory (Namibia) of their natural resources, and continued their dehumanizing acts of suppression.2. Southern RhodesiaFor over ten years the United States has verbalized its condemnation of the racist policies of the lan Smith regime. However, the U.S. Congress with Presidential concurrence has passed legislation violating the United Nations boycott by the resumption of chrome shipments to the USA. Our Government has done nothing more than engage in verbal wrist-slapping, while the evil White minority of less than 300,000 continues to deny to the Black majority of over 5 million their right of majority rule in Southern Rhodesia.3. South AfricaOver the past five decades U.S. private enterprise, with governmental concurrence, has climbed to the top of the investors' pyramid in South Africa. The profits accruing to white multinational corporation stockholders range from 17 to 35 per cent annually and are gained through the inhuman exploitation of the 16 million Blacks of South Africa. An inventory five years ago revealed that fifty-three members of the U.S. Senate owned stock in Englehart's South African gold, uranium and diamond mines.While the government continues to give lip service to United States support of the United Nation's efforts, through boycott and other peaceful techniques, to isolate the racist whites of Southern Africa, the U.S. State Department's ""Operation Tar-baby"" reveals the cynical nature of our real policy toward Southern Africa. It discloses White America's Machiavellian scheme to subvert by massive financial and even military assistance to the governments of Southern Africa, and thereby to perpetuate the inhuman exploitation of millions of Blacks by 4 million whites--who are no more than the surrogates of the industrialized West and the multinational corporations which flourish there.For decades the indigenous people of Southern Africa have called for help, only to be fed the pablum of patience and forbearance by the colonialists.The social pathology of racism, the most evil manifestation of which is apartheid, cannot be dealt with on the basis of objective negotiation and accommodation. Such medicine finds no place in the treatment of social psychopaths. If discussion, negotiations and accomplishments would have freed the Blacks of Southern Africa, they would have been freed eons ago.(Parenthetically Mr. President, if conversation could end racism, then American Blacks would have been first-class citizens eons ago!)The less than four million whites in Namibia, Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe and South Africa are really the solicitor of the multinational corporations of the United States, England, France, Belgium, Holland and West Germany, whose only god is profits. The governments of the West, if the will to do so existed could end the human miseries in Southern Africa overnight. It is one thing to condemn military solutions to the problems with which apartheid and racism have burdened the Blacks of Southern Africa; but to speak as a bully to a small nation of eight and a half million Cubans, who heard the cries of suffering and have responded by sending men and material to help them gain their liberation by force of arms, is the height of duplicity.Revolution is rarely and exportable commodity; wars of national liberation do not comply with the myth of the domino theory.It is to be expected that the United States would oppose military assistance by Cuba, the USSR or any other government to the freedom fighters of the three lands discussed in this letter, and it is not surprising that the world's most powerful nation would caution oppressed people to ""use patience and forbearance"" in their attempt to remove themselves from the hell of oppression. But, what alternatives does the United States Government offer? We can no longer continue to exploit the human and natural resources of Black Southern Africa, on one hand, while denying to these Africans the right of access to military material with which to liberate themselves. I submit to you, Mr. President, that we tread lightly in our efforts to frighten Cuba by bellicose words. Twenty-five million Blacks in America are not unconcerned about the fate of those in Black Africa who have suffered far too long, and been far too patient in their endurance of human oppression!The time has come when the viability of our concept of freedom and liberty is being severely tested. The oppressed Blacks of Southern Africa have been forced toward the ultimate action of the oppressed, the use of force of arms and bloodshed, as their only means of freeing themselves and their lands from the exploiters who suffer the pathology and mythology of racial superiority. I am sure the Black majorities of these three lands would welcome a peaceful solution to their problem, but you and I know that the multinational corporations are too greedy and the profits too dear to yield to conversation.If we do not want bloodshed, if we do not want a nuclear holocaust in Southern Africa, what substantive contribution is the United States prepared to make toward the liberation of these oppressed peoples?","1976",0,1

Just so, in the lessons on reconciliation we are not talking about a little religious misunderstanding, but real enmity and a dramatic effort to make peace, even atthecost of Christ's life.I. GENTILES HAD CORRUPTED MINDS, [Rom. 1:28-32In the early vs of Rom., Paul expressed his warm interest in the believers in the capital city, and then in vs. 16, 17 he summarized his faith in the Gospel of Christ: ""the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth"". The rest of the chapter describes the unrighteousness of the Gentiles.These last five verses specify twenty evil practices which grew out of Gentile refusal to acknowledge God. For that reason, God let their minds become corrupt. Without any influence for right conduct working in them, they became progressively more vicious and anti-social.II. JEWS ALSO WERE DISOBEDIENT, [Rom. 2:1-5].As he wrote, Paul may have imagined the selfrighteous reaction of Jews to this castigation of sinful pagans. So here he turned to his Jewish readers in words like these.""When you pass judgment on others but are committing the same sins, you are really condemning yourself."" Readily would they agree that God judges sinners according to truth, but v3 suggests that the Jews did not expect to be judged in the same way as the pagan. Paul was saying that being the chosen people with the law did not excuse the Jews from obeying the law.III. GOD IS IMPARTIAL IN JUDGMENT, [Rom. 2:6-11].God evaluation of our lives is always impartial, His judgment is going on all the time, with the last one based on the evidence of a whole life time. In God's eyes white people will not get any special treatment nor will Black people.Baptists and Catholics will get the same kind of hearing.","1976",0,0

"598","",1976-03-06,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The Mount Sutro Community Master Plan at best was an honest effort on the part of a coalition of neighborhood groups in the Mt. Sutro, Haight-Ashbury and Inner Sunset areas to protect the environmental needs of these areas while limiting the land acquisition and physical expansion of the University of California Medical Center, San Francisco.Neighborhood interests should have primacy in the consideration of neighborhood needs however the University of California Medical Center is not a neighborhood institution. As probably the nation's finest public tax-supported medical center it belongs to all of San Francisco. California, and the nation. We would oppose exclusive efforts on the part of a Western Addition Community Master Plan to limit the physical growth and development of the Mount Zion and Medical Center. As in the case of the University of California Medical Center, Mount Zion is an institution satisfying broad neighborhood, county and national needs. San Franciscans glorify in the fact that despite our 42 square miles of geographical area we represent a multitude of ethnic, racial and cultural neighborhoods. The question comes: when does the neighborhood's goring of the community ox reach dangerous proportions?In the recent Town Meeting held by the San Francisco Planning Commission at John Adams School. the presentations of both Sutro Master Plan advocates and the UC Medical Center administrators had merit. However, it seems, that both entities have been talking at each other from a position of intransience rather than talking and working with each other to prevent the UC Medical Center from becoming a devouring land acquistion monster through the right of eminent domain, while the environmental needs of the surrounding communities go to pot.Contrarywise the potential beast in the environmental camps must not be allowed to literally stifle and destroy, through environmental parameters, a great medical center which recently has responded to the mandate of affirmative action in professional and paraprofessional training of racial minorities as well as the employment of nonprofessional and professional minorities.The Community Master Planners state cryptically that they are against the unrestrained expansion policies of the Medical Center, moreover, the Master Planners demand preferential employment for neighborhood residents. While the planners state what they are against, the Master Planners give very little attention to positive steps to implement their suggested alternative of neighborhood sateilite UC Medical facilities.Too little attention is given to the historical reasons for placing UC Medical Center on Mt. Sutro's slopes: It was located there primarily because of the sparse population, with open space for expansion. However, the years have intervened and Mt. Sutro and environs have become one of San Francisco's most sought-after residential areas. Not until after the 1952 Supreme Court decision declaring restrictive residential covenants unconstitutional were racial minorities allowed to own and occupy property in the various neighborhoods, who coalesced to form the Community Master Plan. While San Francisco's racial minorities comprise 43.4% of the city's population, these racial minorities had very litte overt or covert opportunity to participate in the structuring of the Mt. Sutro Master Plan. The suggested preferential hiring mandate is illegal, and racial minorities would certainly challenge it in the federal courts.This initial neighborhood-citizen effort, contains an important ingredient for cooperation between environmental devotees and academicians. To achieve the desirable Master Plan, we suggest that a coordinating council of neighborhoods on one hand, and the University community on the other, be urged to engage in a meaningful dialogue which would preserve and further the increased role of the University of California Medical School, San Francisco in the expanding national health delivery programs while at the same time providing a decent neighborhood environment in which the children of San Francisco would develop to adulthood. We urge the San Francisco Planning Commission to defer final judgemnt until the results of such a suggested cooperative endeavor can be placed before it for resolution of this problem.","1976",1,0

Moreover, the appointment of two women to the Police Commission, and racial . . . important boards and commissions that have been installed over the past four weeks is encouraging to those who long have felt that women, racial minorities and the gay community represented important citizenship interest areas which must be given new opportunities to participate in all levels of local, state and national government. The policy in the executive branch of San Francisco will be more meaningful to the cntire city, if these heretofore neglected minorities are allowed to participate in the distillation process which must be achieved in arriving at a democratic consensus.While the Mayor seems to be redeeming his campaign promises and a personal commitment that has been reflected throughout his career as a public servant as Supervisor, State Senator, now Mayor, the action of the President of the Board of Supervisors, Quentin Kopp, indicated there is trouble ahead for Mayor Moscone and those who finally achieved political power through the electoral process. The appointment by Quentin Kopp of Supervisor John Barbagelata as Chairman of the Finance Committee, Board of Supervisors, is a covert attempt (with the collusion of Kopp) to install powerful finacial interests in the key committee, which can make or break efforts of Mayor Moscone to develop new programs by more equitable sharing of the city's 1976-77 budget which will exceed $800 million.While Quentin Kopp bears the label of a Liberal Democrat his behavior demonstrats that he would be more comfortable in the camp of the most conservative Republicans Kopp's blast against Speaker Leo McCarthy and the Congressmen Burton for supporting Art Agnos in the 16th Assembly District and his criticism of Agnos for lending assistance to the Hunters Point Bayview community is yet another blast on the part of a ""know-nothing"" who started his political career along with Barbaqelata in opposition to busing as a means of implementing the mandate of the Federal District Court.With Quentin Kopp and Barbagelata operating as the Katzenjammer Twins on the Board of Supervisors.

The real harm in the recent vote fraud scandal, according to Stoen, occurred in the act of voting, not registering others to vote. Wilson was not accused of voting fraudulently, in fact her supporters have pointed out that she didn't vote at all in last November's election, nor did the people she is accused of signing up improperly.Wilson's attorney Philip Martin stresses that the educed charges were brought about by the District Attorney's office on its own and did not result from plea bargaining. He says his client is still innocent and the new charges will be defended as vigorously as the old.Stoen, who took over the Wilson prosecution and assumed command of the whole vote fraud crackdown after the case was already underway, says he thinks Wilson will be found guilty but will not have to go to jail. If she were to be convicted, he says he would leave her sentencing up to the judge and not make any recommendation.The crackdown meanwhile has begun to expand beyond the Wilson prosecution and has touched some of the bigger fish that the city's residents have been complaining about for months. Three indictments turned in by Stoen's office last week charged a top labor official a Fire Department batallion chief and a Montgomery Street insurance broker with vote fraud.The fire chief entered a no contest plea and the judge placed him on probation and required him to do public service as part of the terms of the probation.

"606","Magnani, Peter",1976-10-14,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","While President Ford and Jimmy Carter debated foreign policy and defense strategies in San Francisco last week, about 4,000 citizens who felt alienated from the scope of their discussion demonstrated outside the heavily guarded Palace of Fine Arts, attempting to draw national attention to the issues they feel are the most important.It was an angry but orderly series of demonstrations, stretching for three blocks along the normally placid Marina District. Protestors carried signs proclaiming their dissatisfaction with the government's action regarding numerous Third World nations, whale fishing, nuclear armament, abortion and a host of other issues. They were watched carefully by a squadron of about 300 policemen, some in riot gear with clubs in hand, some on horseback along the plush lawns of the Palace.By far the largest and most organized of the demonstration was the one protesting current government policy toward southern Africa. Called by the Coalition for Liberation of Southern Africa, the demonstration emphasized opposition to the Ford Administration's so-called ""Kissinger Plan"" for eventual majority rule in Rhodesia. They also attacked challenger Jimmy Carter for failing to propose a workable alternative to the Kissinger Plan, which is opposed by prominent Black Americans and by leaders of the main Black African countries.According to one of the Coalition's organizers, the fact that the southern African demonstration was so large and attracted people of such a wide variety of interests, ""obviously indicates that this is an issue of considerable importance to the American people."" She said it was a sign of the public's determination not to repeat the horrors of Vietnam in Africa.But she blasted the Republican and Democratic candidates for their lack of substantive discussion of the issues and for using the debates as a forum for misleading the American people. She compared Ford's suggestions that all of Africa is pleased with the Kissinger Plan with the kind of false information that was fed to the public to justify the Vietnam War. ""Any policies based on official lies have to be inadequate because they are built on a false foundation,"" she said.The debates themselves have come under fire from several unexpected sources during the past week, because of their tameness and inattention to some of the major issues of the day. Congressman Andrew Young, one of the top guns in the Carter campaign, candidly described last week's Ford-Carter confrontation as ""dull,"" And Federal Communications Commissioner Benjamin Hooks said he thought debates would be more interesting if the network had been allowed to run them instead of the League of Women Voters. ""We might even see a Black reporter,"" Hooks suggested.He was referring to the League's failure, so far, to implement demands by the Black Press that they and other minority groups be allowed to join the panel of journalists who ask the questions at the debates. So far all of the questioning journalists have been white, although the League of Women Voters claims it has been fair in selecting panel members.Hooks said it was a mistake to allow the debates to be classified as a ""news event,"" thus circumventing equal time provisions which would have guaranteed a platform to other presidential candidates besides the front-running Ford and Carter.As it happened, the San Francisco debate covered a board range of foreign policy issues superficially and barely mentioned any of the subjects raised by the demonstrators. It was eerie to walk through the crowd hearing slogans about liberation for Africa, Chile, Iran, Puerto Rico, the Phillipines and other areas under the American sphere of influence, while hearing snatches of Ford and Carter on transistor radio at the same time mulling over the effects of a communist Italian government on NATO, or whether or not eastern Europe is dominated by the Soviet Union.","1976",0,1

However in our opinion we think it is still important and have chosen to run it now. Thank you.Before the playoffs began the Golden State Warriors were the favorites to win their 2nd consecutive National Basketball Association title with very little opposition except from perhaps the Boston Celtics.The favorites were given a fright by the determined Detroit Pistons then faced the Phoenix Suns, surprise winners over the Seattle Supersonics.That series seems destined to run down to the last game of the best of seven series.If the Warriors lose to the Suns, a team which they should have beaten by now, they have only themselves to blame because their brillance has been offset by some of the idiotic play ever witnessed by a team which calls itself the world's champions.In the first contest of the series, the Golden Staters complained about an early starting time and then eclipsed the Suns before a national television audience.In games two and four, a good college team could have beaten the Warriors, all they had to do was show up.""We weren't ready to play,"" Coach Al Attles, said after the Suns and evened series at one-game apiece.""You have to be prepared mentally."" Attles went on. ""Some guys got carried away arguing with the referees and didn't carry, out the game plan.""The game plan was to cut off the Suns guards. Paul Westphal and Ricky Sobers, if they drove the center lane.The two guards not only drive the lane but scored 50 points between them. No one picked them up.Even though Rick Barry scored 44 points there were times when he wasn't giving 100 percent.There seemed to be no way the Suns could beat the Warriors in the first overtime Sunday but someone up there likes them or maybe it's the Warriors who feel sorry for them.Then George Johnson, after the Warriors take a four point lead in the second overtime; gets a key rebound and losses the outlet pass to Phoenix forward, Garfield Heard.He could have kept the ball or thrown the ball with one hand to guard Phil Smith who had released early and was on his way to the basket. Instead the Suns return and score.Instead of a possible six points in front the Warriors lead was now only two points.Even Attles can be criticized for using Gus Williams, who has been atrocious in the playoffs, in front of Charlie Dudley. Dudley is surehanded and make good things happen when he is in the game, yet, he got into the second game when time was running out in the first half and the Warriors were losing.The Californians better start doing a few mental exercises or they will be watching Phoenix playing Boston like the rest of us.Photo (Curtis Perry signals his happiness in Phoenix upset of Golden State.)","1976",0,0

Jim Jones of People's Temple will be among the speakers at Friday's Protest Meeting called to defend the Black majority in southern Africa.The meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m. November 12 at the Queen Adah Hall, 1390 Turk Street, San Francisco. Other speakers will include Leonard Mudavanhu of ZANU, the Zimbabwe African National Union, and Tony Thomas, author of ""Freedom Struggle in South Africa.""The meeting will focus on the liberation struggles in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), South Africa, and Namibia, which have intensified since the withdrawal of Portuguese colonialists from Angola, left those areas, as the last bastions of white-minority rule in the southern part of the continent.The major struggle is taking place in South Africa, the citadel of racism and oppression in Africa. Blacks in South Africa have been in open rebellion against apartheid since last June, engaging in actions the white media describe as ""race riots."" Since the revolt began, more than 300 Blacks and Coloreds have been murdered. Thousands more have been arrested or exiled.Even those figures represent only a small portion of the terror of apartheid, the brutal system by which 4 million whites have exercised oppressive controls over 18 million Blacks and another 2.5 million Coloureds and Indians.A major focus in Friday's meeting will be on U.S. government and corporate responsibility for the problems in southern Africa. The American government is one of the strongest backers of the white regime in South Africa. U.S. corporations have more investments in that country than in all other African nations combined. Some 360 corporations have sunk more than $1.5 billion in the South African economy, where the return on investments is higher than anywhere else in the world, largely due to the exploitation of Black workers. The U.S. government had supported corporate activities in South Africa by vetoing and ignoring United Nations sanctions against trade with that country.The situation is even worse in Namibia, a trust territory illegally ruled by South Africa, where foreign companies are ruthlessly attempting to extract as much of the area's natural resources as possible, including rich deposits of uranium, nickel, and other vital metals, before the inevitable independence finally arrives. South Africa, meanwhile, is trying desperately to hang onto its sovereignty there, by suppressing freedom fighters and tightening up restrictions on travel by the Black majority and otherwise denying basic civil rights to Blacks in that country.American interference is strongest right now in Zimbabwe, where the so-called ""Kissinger Pian is being put into effect in a last-minute attempt to ensure the continuation of political, economic, and social oppression once lan Smith's white-minority regime has ceded power. The Kissinger Plan is hailed by the white American press as a widely accepted blueprint for peace, even though it has been denounced by Black leaders throughout Africa and the United States.The future of Zimbabwe is being discussed by freedom fighters and world leaders meeting this week in Geneva, Switzerland. ZANU's Mudavanhu is attending that conference and is expected to deliver an eyewitness report to the protest meeting in San Francisco on Friday. The public is invited to attend.

Several schools throughout the Bay Area were used to express priorities of the schools.For instance, John O'Connell School in San Francisco is the only public high school in the Bay Area that offers a wide variety of vocational training programs.At the Arts Magnet School in Oakland children are encouraged to develop as individuals at their own speed and in the manner which is best suited for them.The Hoover Elementary School in Palo Alto stressed a return to the basics--the 3R's: reading, writing and arithmetic At Hoover, ""structure"" and ""discipline"" are the key words fundamentals are emphasized, homework is frequent and dress codes are mandatory.This WE THE PEOPLE program included interviews and comments by Dr. Ruth Love, Oakland Schools Superintendent; Dr. Robert Alioto, San Francisco Superintendent of Public Instruction: Jim Baliard President of the San Francisco Federation of Teachers and Dr. Wilson Riles.Bay Area residents were able to voice their choice by voting on ballots listing the questions and choices printed in TV Guide and in all Bay Area locations of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores, Imperial Savings Banks and Grodins clothing stores.

"611","Parks, Laura",1976-09-04,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","From Montreal, Canada, to Pretoria, South Africa, gold was at issue. In both places emotions ran high, tempers flared and justice triumphed. In both cases the issues were often blurred by sentimentality and the mass media's appeal to misplace enthusiasms.The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 1973, has come into force. Under the Convention Apartheid is declared a crime against humanity, violating international law and constituting a threat to international peace and security. The convention defines the term ""crime of Apartheid"" to include ""policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practiced in South Africa"". In its special bulletin on the Olympics, the United Nations declared that, ""The General Assembly supports the Olympic principle that no discrimination be allowed on the grounds of race, religion or political affiliation; has condemed the South African government for its enforcing of racial discrimination and segregation in ports and has called for the ending of exchanges with South African sports teams selected in violation of the ""olympic principle"". It notes further, ""that the campaign to boycott South African sports teams, selected on the basis of Apartheid and in violation of the Olympic principle of non discrimination has been an important measure which has effectively demonstrated the abhorrence of Apartheid on the part of governments and peoples"". And again, ""Commends all governments, sports bodies and other organizations for the boycott of racially selected South African sports, bodies established on the basis of Apartheid.""To the managers of the New Zealand Rugby team; please note, for it was your team's tour of South Africa which forced the massive African-Arab-Carribean sports walk out at the Olympics. The walk out was a magnificent tribute to the memory of Soweto's murdered children. The medals that the great African athletes were certain to win in Montreal have become more precious than all the gold in the world; by their action the African athletes hastened the day when Soweto will one day send its sons and daughters to some future olympics.Seven hundred tons of gold. To the dismay and sorrow of South Africa, the International Monetary Fund will sell, over the next four years, seven hundred tons of gold on the world market to raise the cash for the under developed and the developing nations. The sales are expected to raise over two and a half billion dollars. The massive selling of gold collapsed the price of the medal from its high of almost 200 dollars an ounce a year ago to 107 dollars an ounce last week. Almost immediately the South African economy was threatened with severe disruptions, rising unemployment, import restrictions and the threat of increasing racial upheavals. Most financial and gold commodity experts were at a loss to explain the sale at this time.The facts in the case are these: The present world economic recovery is continuing, yet the recovery is taking place amidst great fears about inflation, the continuing presence of high unemployment and the duration of the recovery in all the industrial nations. The revovery is further marred by the acute and persistent monetary troubles in Italy, France and England, all seeking to undercut each other in the international competition. This is certainly the most dangerous sign at this early stage of economic recovery. The twenty leading industrial nations of the world decided to take steps to expand their markets. By encouraging the economies of the developing nations it is hoped that this will increase their purchasing power to a level where they will be able to absorb the production of the severely competitive industrial world.Two and a half billion dollars won't do the trick, but it is expected that the industrial world will be forced to lend the developing nations increasing sums of money over the next decade to guaranty markets for some of its exports.The gold sale has this further effect; it removes some two and a half billion dollars from world's inflationary economies and will tend to prolong the recovery as a result. Politically the sale of gold is a reminder to South Africa that the industrial world in its long term calculations has placed its economic marbles with the vast and developing markets of the Third World nations, the sworn enemies of the South African regime. The present South African government is clearly expendible.In Montreal valiant men and women spurned the gold medals for the sake of humanity. In Pretoria, the International Monetary Fund was feeding the South African regime small gold pellets as if they were cyanide pills.Photo (Dr. William Harvey, center, vice president of Tuskegee Institute, is presented the winner's trophy for the men's double event in the recent ""Tennis Week in Los Angeles"" for the benefit of the National Negro College Fund.

"612","Robertson, Gene",1976-12-09,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","A TRAGIC DEATH: When GOOFREY CAMBRIDGE dropped dead last week in Hollywood while filming a television special on the now historic raid on Entebbe, it sent shock waves reverberating, not only throughout the entertainment world, but through years of pleasant memories cherished by this writer as well. Memory is often a fragile thing, however, and, while I can remember the first time I met Godfrey and did an interview on him, I can't remember how many years ago it was. I do, however, remember that it was at the old hungry i, where so many as then comparatively unknown entertainers were ""discovered"" and began their--in many instances, at least--meteoric rises to fame (Dick Gregory, Bill Cosby, the Smothers Bros., and Barbra Streisand, to name a few who went on to become internationally famed and acclaimed performers). I also remember that GODFREY CAMBRIDGE possessed not only a finely hoped sense of humor but charisma to spare. I also remember that we met several times during the following years and each encounter or reunion left me with a new sense of warmth and respect. The last time I saw GODFREY CAMBRIDGE was in Hollywood quite a few years ago when he was starring inWatermelon Man, and it proved rewarding in several respects in that I had previously met (and interviewed) both MELVIN VAN PEEPLES and D'URVILLE MARTIN. Melvin, a former cable car gripman here in San Francisco, had had to go to Europe following his stint here in the aforementioned job in order to achieve proper recognition (and realization) of his immense and multiple talents. I did not, however, know him at that time, and it was not until he returned to this city (in a fittingly triumphant state, I'd say) to participate in San Francisco's famed annual international film festival as director of Story of a 3-Day Pass, a stunningly beautiful film about an interracial romance. The film was highly acclaimed, and only then did Melvin receive offers to direct Hollywood films. I met him during the festival, and we established an almost immediate rapport. I had previously met D'URVILLE MARTIN when he had appeared here in a production at Marines Memorial Theater of LeRoi Jones's The Toilet. Unknown at that time, he, too, went on to achieve recognition of his talents; while he later appeared in a series of films with Fred Williamson, only in the past few years has he managed to achieve his goals and only last month it was announced that D'URVILLE MARTIN was now directing as well as co-producing an independent film, Disco 9000, a Black-themed film with JOHN POOLE IV in the lead role as a Hollywood disco owner. Thus did Cambridge's death bring back a flood of memories involving all three of these warm, talented men.ANNUAL APPEARANCE: The S.F. Symphony's recent announcement of its 1976-77 65th season carried the welcome news that pianist ANDRE WATTS would indeed be making his annual appearance with the symphony, and this season that will be on Jan. 5, 6, and 7. He is scheduled to play Franck's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra and Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 2.PETER FINCH, who stars in Network, MGM's controversial new film that opens this Fri., Dec. 10, at the Metro Theater, was in town last week (with his lovely Jamaican-born wife) to talk about his role in the film. ""One of the best of my career,"" he termed it. He estimated his other best role as that of the doctor in Sunday, Bloody Sunday (for which he won an Academy Award nomination), although conceding he didn't have as much screen time in Network as he did in Sunday. Though he is now a resident alien, making his home in Los Angeles, he was living in Jamaica at the time his agent sent him the script to read. ""When I first read the script, I knew I had to take the part,"" he said. As one might gather from the title, the story deals with TV, and Finch plays a TV anchorman who goes berserk in front of the camera on the evening news. ""It's a great role,"" he said. ""It's a comedy part with tragic overtones, and that's the best kind an actor can have,"" he continued. ""The really good films today,"" he maintained, ""are made by independents who have the courage to buck the studio system....except occasionally for a film like Network."" He cited One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as a recent example of an independently made film that was an outstanding hit but had originally been turned down by all the major studios. Network, though controversial, has proved such a hit that, at its New York opening, a second theater had to be taken over because the first theater wouldn't accommodate all the patrons.Photo (CAMBRIDGE ...a tragic, untimely death)","1976",0,0

If Kissinger had journeyed to the capitals of the six western nations which now exploit South Africa, and worked out a treaty of withdrawal of western capitalists and their henchmen from the sordid business of enforcing the wicked and racist Apartheid system the purpose of guaranteeing world peace and relieving the threat of a third nuclear war from the human race would have been more advantageously served.Kissinger should not be praised; he should be accused and tried before the bar of world public opinion for the mischief in which he is engaged.","1976",0,1

They charged that the actions contemplated by officials of the lame-duck Ford Administration threaten to undo the progress made during the last decade by women and minority workers seeking jobs with the thousands of companies that hold federally funded contracts.The new proposals, which were drawn up by Labor Department staff and which could go into effect before President Ford leaves office on Jan. 20, ""promote the concept that federal contractors should have a free rein in implementing affirmative action or not,"" according to Henry Der of Chinese for Affirmative Action in San Francisco. Der made the charge at a press conference, joined by representatives of the city's Human Rights Commission. Bayview-Hunters Point Affirmative Action, Mission Hiring Hall, Women Organized for Employment, Advocates for Women, and Pilipinos for Equal Employment.Der said that the new guidelines were drawn up after Labor Department officials conferred with businessmen. No minority input was sought during the process, he added.The new guidelines, if adopted, would exempt employers from federal affirmative action rules if they have fewer than 100 employees and contracts of less than $100,000. That compares with existing procedures, which apply to anyone with more than 50 employees and contracts of at least $50,000.In addition, the time period for processing complaints against companies would be considerably lengthened, and provisions for denying future government contracts to companies that violate affirmative action laws would be removed. Der and the others said they fear this would lead to wholesale violation of minority hiring guidelines, since companies would find that economic sanctions were not being imposed on them.Vince Sanabria of the Mission Hiring Hall called the proposed revisions ""a betrayal and a conspiracy."" He said Labor Department officials are engaged in a ""concerted effort to deal a fatal blow to minorities.""According to Martha Silver of Advocates for Women, the new guidelines are being drafted now because companies are suddenly discovering that the civil rights legislation drafted since 1964, and particularly Executive Orders dating back to the Johnson Administration mandating affirmative action in federal contracts, are finally beginning to work. Suits and complaints filed during the past ten or 12 years for noncompliance are beginning to be settled and businesses are finding that the process is costing them a great deal of money. Silver speculated. So they have begun to pressure Labor Department officials to water down their regulations.But affirmative action groups plan to apply pressure of their own. Although they have been denied a role in the revising of the procedures so far, they have got the department to hold four public hearings around the country before the new rulings are acted on. Representatives from several Northern California affirmative action groups plan to attend the hearing scheduled for next week in Los Angeles.If the new procedures are adopted in spite of their protests, the groups say they plan to pressure the new Carer Administration to see that they are removed.Representatives of the Labor Departments Office of Federal Contract Compliance were not available for comment by press . . .","1976",0,1

"626","",1976-10-03,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","""Look! What A Wonder!"" a Rainbow Sign production opened at the Berkeley Community Theater October 2nd, is more than just a major West Coast produced musical dramatization of the Black experience in America. It represents a dream come true for Rainbow Sign Director Mary Ann Pollar who conceived the idea two years ao.Pollar was at a rare Bay Area Odetta performance, where the world renowned folksinger was belting but a round of songs that eventually and very eleverly ended where it began Pollar who had the seeds for a production germinating in her head, was so impressed with this technique that reminded her of the African concept of the circle of time that she immediately knew her production should take the same form.She got Odetta's commitment to star in her production that night a year ago, because she says. ""Without Odetta, there's no production. From there Bay Area poet-playwrite Joyce Carol Thomas was commissioned to write the script.In recent years Black theatrical productions have dominated the theater scene in New York and then fanned out to other cities with national touring companies. What makes ""Look! What A Wonder!"" unique is that the production imtiates from the West Coast and with the exception of Odetta and a few others, the cast and production staff is local. ""There is a wealth of untapped talent in the Bay Area and 'Look! What A Wonder!"" will given them the opportunity to display it in a first calls production,"" explained Pollar.Since the initial organization of the production about a year ago, new people have joined in making it happen. Among them is Emanuel Thomas, Los Angeles actor and director, who will direct the production. Writer director, who will direct the production Writer director Maya Angelou, consultant. Akih Denianke, choreographer. Bill Bell, musical director. Fundi, set designer; and Joe Moore, visual director have all put in hard creative hours to make Pollar's dream a reality.""Look! What A Wonder!"" is many things but zssentially its a celebration of Black life through poetry, song, dance and dialogue. There have been many such productions that have touted the same theme, however this one differs in that every dance and song has been thorougly researched for authematicity by anthropologist Amabra Hicks, who is assistant producer. Although it is 1976, the field hollers, work songs, chants and spirituals and the shuffle, shim sham and the Tac Anme dances will be historically orrect. The facts will be too . . .Because of this feature, the City of Berkeley and its Bi-Centennial Commission have designed it one of Berkeley's few ""official"" Bi-Centennial events.Every segnent of he community has become involved in this production including community organizations, the business community, religious groups and civic organizations. Income from the production will enable Rainbow Sign, a non-profit Berkeley based cultural center to offer quality cultural programs to the Bay Area community.""Look! What A Wonder!"" will be performed for two weeks only from October 2nd to October 16th. Pollar and others who are associated with the production agree hhat during that two weeks. Berkeley will be the Black cultural capital of the United States.","1976",1,0

On July 11, she performed in a free concert. ""An Afternoon of Yesterday's Jazz,"" at the Ingleside Community Center in San Francisco.Jewel ""Sweetie"" Mitchell, a native San Franciscan, began her singing career in high school and church choirs, as have many major singers.Centered in the San Francisco Bay Area, in the 1940's, she sang with the Booker T. Washington Community Center band and the Ben Watkins band. She also had her own band, playing and singing at many of the San Francisco clubs of the time, such as the California Theatre Restaurant, Ciro's, Say When and Cafe Society Downtown. Her group also played intermissions for Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Joyce Bryant, and the Ink Spots in many of these clubs.During the 1950's she sang with the big bands of Gerald Wilson, Cedric Hayward and her late husband Eddie Walker. She also traveled as a single, taking in the clubs in Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta and many other cities.Sweetie has a smooth, mellow style. Her voice is still rich with husky, sultry tones, somewhat reminiscent of Chric Connor, June Christy, and Ella Fitzgerald, but her own style has a smooth comfortable delivery.You can tell she is a 'Pro'--a really down singer.She started her set with ""I Love All Of You,"" followed by ""Imagination,"" ""Sugar,"" and ""More Than You Know,"" then she swung into ""I Hate to see the Evening Sun Go Down,"" she really got down on this one.The remainder of the set included tunes like ""I Got it Band,"" ond ""Street of Dreams."" She closed the set by jamming with ""Time After Time.""The ""Lady"" was lovely.Her accompanist on piano was John Marabuot, and on bass was Terry Hilliard, who played regularly with Cal Tjader until 1966. Hilliard also conducts the music staff at Faith Presbyterian Church in Oakland. Marabuto leads a group with Hilliard in the East Bay called ""Tottle OO."" Both gentlemen will be doing a gig at Half Moom Bay in September. John and Terry cooked on a version of ""Willow Weep for Me.""The second set started with a young tap dancer named Carla, a member of the ""Body Language Dance Troupe.""Sweetie Mitchell opened her second set with ""East of the Sun.""The ""Lady"" really moves on out in the second half.

"628","",1976-04-24,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","A public meeting has been called for noon Saturday, April 24 at the Buchanan Street YMCA to present the final plans for district election of supervisors for community approval.A drafting committee has drawn up boundaries for separating San Francisco, into eleven districts which, if approved on Saturday, will be presented to the voters in November in the form of a proposition seeking to elect city supervisors by district rather than at large as the present law requires.A similar proposal was defeated at the polls in 1973. However, sponsors of the current drive feel the vote might go differently this time, largely because of the large amount of grass roots input into the drafting of the districts.Since January, some 500 San Franciscans have attended 16 neighborhood meetings to discuss details of the districting plan. The hearings have been sponsored by more than 130 community organizations and activists in what the sponsors call the greatest amount of citizen participation ever attained for a city initiative. Saturday's meeting will represent the culmination of the process.Supporters of District Elections believe that the city would be managed better by supervisors who were required to be residents of particular neighborhoods from which they would be elected. At present, all San Franciscans have to elect each member of the Board of Supervisors at large. This results in a board with many members who live in the same part of town and share similar social and economic backgrounds while other geographic and economic sectors are unrepresented.District Elections are seen as a means of broadening community influence at City Hall.","1976",1,0
"629","Robertson, Gene",1976-08-28,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","I STAND subject to correction as to PAM GRIER'S entire film career but I think most of her films have been made for American International Pictures, where she was discovered while working as a switchboard operator. Certainly her first films were made for that studio and included such as ""Black Mama, White Mama,"" ""Big Doll House,"" ""Women in Chains,"" ""Hit Man,"" ""Foxy Brown,"" ""Coffy,"" ""Scream, Dracula, Scream,"" and possibly several others whose titles escape me. Statistics will show that each of these films (all comparatively low budget) made huge sums of money. It was a period when A.I.P. (and many of the other studios) were making the so-called ""Blaxploitation"" films (and man, did they make money!). Many negative articles were written about this period and I've always believed most of those articles had a certain amount of validity. However, there's the other side of the coin too and I admire (and generally agree with) what Pam Grier had to say about ""Blaxploitation"" films in a recent interview. In short, she said she felt they were justified. Her quote was: ""A lot of people got work and were able to join unions because of those films. They're working and learning and in the business now.""PAM GRIER'S newest film, ""DRUM"" while not for A.I.P., is labeled controversial by most people, racist by some and cinematic trash by others. A United Artists release, ""Drum"" is a sequel to ""Mandingo"" and has boxer KEN NORTON playing his second film role. One suspects that Norton is a far better athlete than he is actor but then numerous other athletes have become film stars so Norton may very well do the same. And despite the generally negative reviews of ""Drum"" the betting is that it will be a box office success (a smash, in fact).BUT whatever, Pam Grier seems to be in demand by other studios at this point and I guess this is due to her training/work at A.I.P. in those exploitation films and that tends to lend validity to her belief that those films were justified. For now comes word that Pam Grier will have the female lead in the still untitled film currently being shot in Georgia by Melvin Van Peebles and based on the unusual life of Wendell Oliver Scott, first Black racing car driver. As I previously itemed, RICHARD PRYOR has the starring role of Scott (who is still living and makes his home in Danville, Va.) but I've just learned that also starring are CLEAVON LITTLE, BEAU BRIDGES, VINCENT GARDENIA, MINNIE GENTRY, RICHIE HAVENS and (as also previously itemed) State Senator JULIAN BOND. This will be a Warner Bros, release and with that director and that cast!!! Wow! It's sure to be a winner!MORE, MORE, MORE (on Richard Pryor, that is): Recently I devoted a short paragraph to RICHARD PRYOR and the increasing (and highly merited) recognition this uniquely talented artist is finally beginning to receive. I mentioned an unusual cotract he had just signed with Universal Pictures (permitting him to both write and act). Now I learn that he has just completed a film (in addition to the previously mentioned ""Car Wash;) titled ""Silver Streak."" An article appears in the Aug. 30 issue of ""New West"" titled ""Richard Pryor is the Blackest Comic of Them All"" and I recommend it as absolute MUST reading (if, that is you're as fanatic a fan of Richard Pryor as is this writer).RANDOM RAMBLING: Granted that the photo used here is not exactly a new one, it's worth noting that the beloved CAB CALLOWAY, one of the nation's most respected jazz musicians and best-loved entertainers in America, will appear on that popular TV program, ""A.M. San Francisco,"" next Tues., Aug. 31, 9-10:30 a.m. KGO Channel 7...And if you missed the off-beat film, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" you might like to know that the LARKIN theatre is now presenting midnite shows of this zany film every Friday and Saturday nite at midnite.

Wanger talked of the demolition of homes, curfews, torture by police investigators and other ""systematic violations of the Geneva Convention which she had documented in her book ""With My Own Eyes.""Mayor Zayyed said that anti-Arab discrimination ""reaches into every area of our lives."" Predominantly Arab cities such as Nazareth, he said, have been the targets of government embargoes, receiving far less federal money than areas inhabited mostly by Jewish Israelis. Zayyed charged that since his recent election, the situation in Nazareth has grown even worse, with funds already appropiated for his city being held up. He reported that most Arab villages have no electricity, sewers or health clinics, in sharp distinction to Jewish cities.Zayyed also talked about the |DdKoenig Report,|DD an infamous set of recommendations made to the national government by a federal district administrator. He called the report ""a racist document"" and criticized it for advocating the supression of dissent and the ""systematic impoverishment of the Arab people."" Zayyed said it was indicative of the racist attitudes permeating the high levels of Israeli government that Prime Minister Yitsak Rabin had said he hadn't read the Koenig Report. ""Everyone in Israel read the report,"" Zayyed said.Wanger and Zayeed criticized the American press for its biased treatment of the situation in Israel, Wanger calling the U.S. ""A place in which the people are ignorant."" She said she and her colleagues had come to the United States to dispel ""the nice image of liberal occupation which still prevails in this country. She blasted the American government for supplying ""the most sophisticated methods of killing"" to Israel and lamented that Ford and Carter are engaged in a competition ""to determine who is more pro-Israeli"" instead of leveling with the American people about what is really going on in the Middle East.As if to punctuate her remarks, a reporter from KPIX television asked about ""Arab terrorists"" and a person from the Chronicle asked whether Arab cities in Israel weren't better off than cities in surrounding Arab countries. KPIX was told that, while nobody in the room condoned terrorism, the only way to stop frustrated people from resorting to violence is to remove the cause of their frustration, in this case the severe oppression of non-Jewish Israelis.On the other question, Zayyed said it was irrelevent to compare conditions in one country with conditions in another when the issue is discrimination among various ethnic groups within a single country. He asked whether a proper comparison could be made between the living conditions of Black Americans and the lives of citizens in underdeveloped Black African nations. The Chronicle reporter agreed it would be ""like comparing apples and oranges,"" but he reported that Zayyed ""admitted"" that Israeli Arab are better off than Arabs in nearby nations.Angela Davis told reporters that the liberation struggle in Israel is ""intimately connected"" with struggles being waged around the world. She pledged to do whatever she can to put more pressure on ""the main ally of Israel, the U.S. government.Later, Emile Touma, a member of the political bureau of the Communist Party of Israel and the author of several weel-known studies of Middle East problems, told the Sun Reporter that his party, to which Zayeed also belongs, considers lasting peace in the Middle East a prerequisite to solving any of the social problems in the area. He outlined the party's four-point program for securing peace, including:-evacuation of all territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.-recognition of the right of refugees to inhabit their homelands,-self-determination for all Palestinians and,-respect for territorial integrity.Photo (Tawfiq Zayyed, the Mayor of Nazareth, attorney Felicia Wanger and Angela Davis spoke to reporters at a press conference in the Sheraton Palace Hotel last week.

Aid in the diplomatic dilemma was sought from Governor Edwin Edwards of Louisiana where Fender spent three years in the State Penitentiary for the possession of two joints in 1961. The governor immediately sent a telegram to the New Zealand officials praising the singer-songwriter.In part, the telegram stated that Governor Edwards granted Freddy Fender a full pardon for his marijuana possession conviction on September 9, 1975, and that the Texas resident was a fine, upstanding, contributing citizen.Authorities in New Zealand reconsidered their decision in the face of such powerful character references, but eventually reinstated their hard-line tactics.

In the wake of the turmoil Black students said, ""We had to watch our backs, so we didn't get jumped."" At the peak, white racist gangs armed with bats, pipes, hockey sticks and razors ambushed Black students at Hyde Park High, shouting, ""Get the niggers!"" These attacks on January 21, were witnessed, unopposed, by school officials.Anti-busing whites held protests in East Boston and Charlestown. Charlestown High students bolted from their classrooms, on January 26, roaming the streets of downtown Boston. They attacked a Black pedestrian in Government Center and beat a white government employee who reprimanded their actions. When a Black family rented a home on the ""wrong side of the street"" in a predominately white section of Dorchester, they were greeted with bands of whites shouting, ""Niggers go home,"" and throwing bricks and bottles through the front windows. When Rubie Bradley, the mother, called police for help they met with a member of ROAR, an anti-posing group, who lived across the street. Later her some was nearly set on fire by the same youth the police refused to arrest.Although the level of physical violence has decreased, the renewed attacks reveal the determination of racists in Boston to turn around desegregation in that city, 37 percent of the public schools are ""racially Imbalanced,"" which means that desegregation has not been implemented for the students. Judge Garrity has decided to postpone Phase III, thereby exempting East Boston from the busing plan. The school committee has recognized private academies in West Roxbury and Hyde Park, helping to promote the white boycott by legitimizing their private institutions against busing. The anti-Black forces have launched a multi-leveled attack on equal rights in Boston.ROAR, (Restore Our Alienated Rights) the largest anti-busing group has become a national organization, including speakers to Detroit, Dallas, Louisville, New York and other cities to help organize anti-busing, anti-Black movements. Using their opposition to busing as a cover these forces are spearheading a war on desegregation and equality.Lack of national news coverage has prevented a public outcry that can defend Black students and families.

Melissa Wilson, a member of the Hyde Park High BiRacial Student Council and Black student leader will be addressing the gathering.

Today interior design is a profession and the designer is expected to be knowledgeable on subjects ranging from basic electric wiring and stress patterns in buildings to the proper maintenance of a variety of synthetic fabrics. the quirks in the newest kinetic art forms, or the findings of the latest environmental study. More and more, interior designers work closely with architects to create interior environments that are more than just rooms.""The above quotation is a statement of fact voiced by the proprietor of Interior Internationale, the newest sensation in interior designing to come to San Francisco. To walk into the foyer of this showcase office at 1451 McAllister St., is to walk into another world. The floor is of Travatini marble, and the walls are covered with pictures painted by Eastern U.S. and European artists.On the immediate right is the living, or the ""front,"" room. The walls are covered with floor-to-ceiling panes of glass separated by strips of plywood. The room has been designed with furniture from different periods, such as European, contemporary, Empire, Oriental, and Indian. The beauty of it all is that it fits perfectly. As the designer says, ""It is a blending of styles, just as people today are blending together.""The usual blurry white medallion that is found in the center of most Victorian living rooms has been stripped and hand-painted by Jeannie Dixon, a member of Darryl's staff. A large fan extends from the medallion and turns slowly, giving the impression of leisurely times and evenings spent on tropical islands. The front windows have been covered with full-length redwood shutters (ordered from Chicago), and recessed lights have been inserted into the ceiling.The rest of the house is just as elegant and luxurious. The two large hall closets, which are standard equipment in San Francisco's Victorian houses, have been put to new uses. The doors have been removed, and one closet has become a bar complete with wine racks and the other is filled with stereo equipment and records.The creator of the experience is Darryl Peebles, a Detroiter turned San Franciscan. Though he has been in the business of interior designing since 1959, it has taken him a while to break into the field in San Francisco. ""I had a hard time finding a job because, in San Francisco, it is basically a white market, and I was told I was too qualified."" He first worked in Los Gatos. After building up a clientele there (which included customers from San Francisco), he was encouraged to open his offices in this city. He now has a staff of five, which comprises Wayne Meyer, business administrator. Gerald Bates, account executive. Ernst Hase, architectural designer, Jeannie Dixon, graphic artist coordinator; and Larry Bunnell, display designer.The staff of Interior Internationale gives consultation on minor points, such as which sofa to buy or how to go about building a house or office from the ground up. His staff do not merely decorate--they design! ""When someone comes in. I have everything at my fingertips. I can show them tiles, fabrics, and furniture designs. We have a full designing service--from logos, napkins, and glassware, to the exterior of the buildings."" Interior Internationale's services include planning, layout, blueprints, renderings, space planning, cost determination, specifications, decoration, and interior design. Some of that designing service is now being used on a new Mini Mall on Presidio Avenue in San Francisco and on the renovation of a three-story Queen Anne Victorian, circa 1870, into a private club called the Phoenix, in Oakland. Peebles is also currently working on residences in and outside of the Bay Area.As I've said, he displays paintings by Eastern and European artists, but he would like to become involved with local artists. His creation sets the scene for art showings and fashion shows, along with other social functions. In some cases he is willing to have showings of paintings or sculptures. He is also interested in apprentice designers--young men and women who are attending designing schools or classes and who would like to learn the art at first hand.""To many, the world of the interior designer is one of esoteric mystery. It is a world of shapes, fabrics, and colors; of trained specialists. Interior designers do not simply rearrange furniture. They merge function and beauty. They adapt this merger to the needs and lifestyles of those who are going to occupy the space for work or shelter,"" Darryl Peebles and the staff of Interior Internationale merge function and beauty fantastically; they are truly a ""total concept in design.""Photo (The creator, Darryl Peebles, receives a phone call in the kitchen, where he has not yet begun to work.

With oratory that matched Ossie Davis's performance in PEARLIE VICTORIOUS, Cobb called for a Federal investigation of the entire Community Development Agency.Cobb claims that he was told by several messenger boys from that agency that unless OCCUR, which is supposed to function as the city's ""watch dog,"" doesn't start watching somewhere else, he and his staff would soon be looking for jobs.These changes, for the most part, appear to be true since OCCUR, which prior to its questions pertaining to the dispersal of Community Development funds, had few funding problems, now finds itself operating on a ninety day budget.However, many of those receiving Community Development handouts, know that Cobb would rather fight, are urging Williams to ""give the turkey some money."" Since many of them know that their operations are better off unnoticed...Such as the deal cooked up between Oakland Metropolitan Enterprises and First Enterprise Bank.In a brilliant display of Black Capitalism monies given to OMI-designed to aid small minority businesses were used to buy stock in the so-called Black bank where unless minority business persons have A-1 credit - and collateral - up the you know what, they might as well apply for dough at the Bank of South Africa.Incidentally, Louis Barnett, who sits on the Board of Directors at First Enterprise Bank, also sits on the Board of Directors at Oakland Metropolitan Enterprises. He claims no conflict of interest because he says he took no part in negotiating the deal.....yea, yea, yea.Meanwhile, John Williams, who by the way is recuperating from major surgery, made his old friend C.J. Patterson so mad that C.J. threatened to sneak into John's hospital room and re-operate.Williams, it seems, had neglected to fund some of C.J.'s bread and butter projects at Golden State Business League. However, Patterson went before the City Council and they gave him his dough.THINGS I SHOULDN'T TELL.....I shouldn't tell Maurice Dawson that the young lady who commutes to and from her job in Sacramento with him is wearing car plugs under her scarf. Says Sylvia Woodley of Berkeley..... ""Three hours of Maurice's mouth everyday had me on the verge of leaping from the car.

Her husband, who is Jewish, still refuses to take a bath.....

Joe Garcia was his top law aid and the likes of Loren Miller. Ivan Johnson. Chris Wright, Charles Matthew, William Taylor. Clarence Jones, Lloyd Griffin, and Bernard Jefferson were the lawyers whose names were in the news. In Northern California their counter part consisted of John Bussey. George Vaughns.

Walter Gordon, Jr. continued to produce young lawyers, and one of them who came through his organization was Hugh Wesley Goodwin. At the time that we started the Law Firm of Thomas L. Berkeley and Associates, which was made up of present. San Francisco Supervisor. Terry Francois. Superior Court Judge. Joseph Kennedy, and Prominent criminal lawyer. Clinton White. I enticed Hugh Wesley Goodwin to come and try his fortunes in Northern California. He had decided to leave Gordon's Los Angeles operation, as it was too flamboyant.Hugh joined our organization in 1950 and stayed with us for a year or so. He then migrated on to Fresno, where he carried on a one-man practice for the next 20 years dealing mostly in indigent cases and carrying the battle of Civil Rights. Last year Hugh Wesley Goodwin was appointed a Municpal Court Judge in Fresno - the First Black municipal Court Judge in that County - and a few days ago Charles Wilson, presently director of Fair Employment Practices Commission to the State of California, sent me a clipping from the Fresno Bee telling some of the exploits of the newly appointed Judge.

"638","Alston, Charlesetta",1976-08-14,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The Board of Education of the State of Virginia issued an edict that in order for a student to receive a high school diploma he must be able to prove he can read and write and perform basic mathematical computation. From recent reports, this looked like the future trend. One writer states, and I concur, that if other states follow this line of action, it could be a radical step that would eventually educate many of our students.Although the Virginia Board will not begin to enforce this rule until 1978, many of the students are already complaining that this decision violates their constitutional rights and is cruel. It's unfortunate that progressive education has been so permissive that students think that all school is about is football, band, and other sports, or a fun place to go While schooling should not be a drudgery, it ought to be an educational plant. Every parent who sends his or her child to school expect to get some basic things. For example, a chid ought to be able to read and write before going Into third or fourth grade. Schools ought to be able to eliminate remedial reading classes in the junior and senior high schools because all students by junior high school should be able to read well enough to at least have a brushing acquaintance with the academic subjects.There are those who argue for the sake of permissiveness that all students are not ready for the academics. And they mean for higher education such as becoming a doctor or a lawyer. By the academics. I mean woodshop, auto mechanics, gardening, janitors: in my small mind, I cannot conceive of a janitor who could not read the label on a can of wax or differentiate between a can of varnish or paint thinner Learning to read must be a prerequisite for almost any endeavor we undertake. and this includes eating. One finds it very difficult to cope with the fancy menus in a restaurant or the bill of fare on a corner food stand. Not to mention going to the supermarket and trying to wend your way through the rows of exotic food to suit the most elaborate cuisine and expect a non-reader to find the things they need without frustration.Hooray for the State of Virginia and for those who follow suit to finally give the taxpayers their money's worth by educating the students.","1976",1,0

"640","",1976-03-27,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Speaking on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus which she chairs. California Congresswoman Yvonne Burke last week urged a committee of her colleagues to act swiftly to pass the revised Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1976.The bill, which is a revised version of the Hawkins Bill submitted to Congress last year, would commit the federal government to initating and pursuing policies geared toward insuring jobs for all Americans. In her testimony before the House Equal Opportunities Subcommittee, chaired by Augustus Hawkins who is also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Burke stressed that the CBC has been a guiding force behind the bill since it was first introduced.She told the committee that full employment is an issue for all Americans, regardless of their ethnic background. ""However, it is in the Black communities where unemployment continually exists at astonishingly high rates, that we must ecphasize and reiterate our particular concerns.""Burke testified that, although recently released figures indicate that the overall unemployment rate in the nation dropped slightly last month, the rate among Black Americans rose, from 13.2 percent in January to 13.7 percent in February. Worse yet, she stated, Black unemployment has been above six percent since 1954.She emphasized that, while these are the official government figures, they do not reflect the total picture, including those who are under-employed and those who have been out of work for so long that they are dropped from the statistics.Regarding he effects of such unemployment. Burke testified ""Over time our youth are being robbed of their self respect, their belief in this society, their ability to subsist and their very future as useful people. The social and psychic havoc being wreaked by joblessness is truly immense. Many of these idie hands turn to crime to make ends meet. Family breakups increase, mental illness further decimates families, and social groups are brought into conflict with each other as they struggle for the few jobs that are available. Over time, this creates a permanent jobless class. And it is our belief that the Black community is bearing the brunt of this frightening return to a caste system.""Burke said the $12 billion price tag that has been placed on the full employment bill is unrealistic, because it fails to consider the estimated $19 billion that was paid out in unemployment and other welfare benefits during the last fical year. ""Individuals in our society are willing to pay billions of dollars to offset the costs of crime, yet can not see these costs being paid into a mechanism for producing productive jobs that shore up the very fabric of our society.The Congresswoman praised the bill for encouraging job development by the private sector and leaving government employment as a ""last resort"" only to be used when private enterprise cannot fill the fill. But she emphasized that it is necessary to mandate the government to produce a program guaranteed to keep people employed. According to Burke, the Hawkins bill ""will fundamentally change the structural defects of our current economic system"" by recognizing that economic incentives to private enterpise will not solve the unemployment problem in the absence of a clear, strong government policy.","1976",1,0

The historically conditioned arrears regarding the qualification of those employed in agriculture have been systematically eliminated during the socialist transformation.In 1963 only 18 out of 100 people employed in socialist agriculture had completed vocational training. Since then the level of qualification has rapidly increased. At the end of 1975 about 80 percent of those employed in agriculture had at least skilled worker's certificates.This development entailed a fundamental change regarding the educational standard of women employed in agriculture. In former times it was quite unusual for farmers' wives to attend vocational training. In 1975, however, 75 percent of all women working in agriculture had completed vocational education. Most of them acquired their skilled worker's certificates during the past 15 years.The endeavors of the rural population to widen their knowledge are being supported by a wide range of institutions that impart knowledge and information concerning various fields. Many of them at the same time foster the people's cultural activities and serve as community centers, such as the houses of culture and the village clubs. Radio and television broadcast special education programs for people working in agriculture.Between 1971 and 1975 some 60,000 persons completed vocational training as agricultural technicians in the framework of the adult education scheme, in the same period about 3,700 working people completed correspondence courses for plant production at technical schools and colleges. Another 1,600 working people completed training as agricultural engineers.The acquisition of knowledge for mastering the immediate tasks of work is gaining more and more importance. These efforts find expression in a growing number of participants in relevant qualification courses.Last year 221,000 working people made use of this opportunity and completed their knowledge. By attending such courses people can acquire, among other things, certificates entitling them to operate a milking plant, driver licenses for the ZT-300 tractor, or licenses for the operation of combine harvesters.Photo (At the vocational training center for industrialized cattle breeding at Dedelow young people attend lessons in a specially equipped room.)","1976",0,0

On May 1, 1974, he went to the Hall of Justice and interviewed 7 men, four of whom were released from jail moments after the talked to them. The remaining three, Larry Green, Manuel Moore and J.C.X. Simon, were charged with being Zebra murderers. A fourth man, Jessie Cooks, was brought in from San Quentin and set up at a Zebra killer.Cooks had confessed to murdering Frances Rose on October 30, 1973. Police decided subsequently that the Rose murder was actually a Zebra killing.Each of the four men was charged with participating in murders and assaults. All of them were charged with conspiracy. All were convicted.""Why did you think you lost the case?""""I don't know exactly. I've done a lot of thinking about it, and I've come to believe that the jury was confused. There were a lot of mistatements of law, and many complex issues which could have led the jury astray.""Judge Karesh made a lot out of the fact that the jury represented a cross section of San Francisco. But the minority members of that jury had troubles.""""That Black young lady who was pregnant slept a lot. I don't know how much of her attention was on the trial. The other Black juror, (an older man) his wife was seriously ill for most of the trial. Then there was juror number 2. She was plagued by personal problems during the entire trial.""I think those members of the jury voted the way which would take the least amount of time.""I don't think the jury clearly understood the legal issues involved. Judge Karesh allowed evidence to be submitted on all the uncharged crimes, saying there was evidence that went to the furtherance of the conspiracy. That left the jury recieving evidence about a number of murders and assaults where no one could identify the assailants, before the District Attorney ever established that a conspiracy existed.""The District Attorney relied on Anthony Harris' testimony, Harris, as a matter of law is an accomplice. His testimony has to be corroberated. He talked of planning meetings. No one else gave evidence about meetings. I don't believe the jury understood about cooperation.""Larry Green was convicted, even though Harris was never corroberated. Harris was the only witness who said that Green participated in the attempt to kidnap those three youngsters.""Carrasco (Michelle Carrasco an 11 year old who testified that three Black men attempted to abduct her and two of her youung friends) identified Cooks and talked about someone who was half white and half Black. That's not a description of Green.""Richard Hague was brutally assaulted that night, he identified Cooks. A policeman identified Harris as a man he remembered around the van. Only Harris said that Green was there. There was no corroberation. Green shouldn't have been convicted.""I say the same for Manuel Moore and Simon (J.C.X. Simon). ""L.C. Green (a Black ex-serviceman who identified Moore as the killer of Jane Holley) is a buffoon. Who else but a buffoon would testify, and insist before the jury that Moore, a very dark Black skinned man, was light skinned.""Then there was Benveniste, who identified Simon as the killer of Tana Smith. I have doubts that Benveniste was actually on the scene. But he told the court how he was confused, how he saw the shooting and then parked his car on the wrong side of the street only to run to the hospital. His girlfriend came to court and told us that he lied--that he told her he was never sure about the man he saw. He said to her that he was 80 to 90 percent sure, but he pointed Simon out in the court as the man he was 100 percent sure killed Tana Smith.""We played a tape, where he told his girlfriend that he never identified Simon. But he had. He lied to her, he told a confused tale to the jury. He should never have been believed.""I know that I'm an advocate, but I am firmly convinced of the innocence of these men.Judge Karesh confused the issue. He refused to allow the jury to see the drawings of the suspects which were made at the direction of some of the surviving victims of attack.""The drawings did not resemble the defendants.""Karesh wouldn't allow the jury to see the affidavit of the police artist. This affidavit, submitted under oath to a Federal Court, maintained that the composites were an accurate rendering of the description of the assailants given him by the victims.""The jury was not allowed to see that affidavit.""The failure to allow the jury to see that material should allow grounds for reversal.""Why didn't the defense ask for a change of venue, taking the case away from the area where citizens were alarmed over the spectre of Blacks murdering whites?""Change of venue is an expensive process. Had we received a change, all of the defense witnesses would have to be transported to the new trial site and housed at defense expense.""Also, where would we go? We would probably be limited to places where they had a secure courtoom. Can't go to Marin, the San Quentin 6 is there Sacramento? They had a similar case of Muslims charged with assaulting whites. San Jose? Los Angeles? Not practical.""Defense lawyers have, up until now, considered San Francisco to be a good place to try cases because of the sophistication and liberal tendencies of San Franciscans. I don't know whether we made a mistake in staying here. I do know that the jury we got didn't weight the facts or consider the issues in this case. I'm dissapointed, I thought that our legal system could work, that four men charged with committing horrible crimes could be afforded justice. I was wrong.""Appelate courts have been known to sidestep issues. I hope they don't do so in this case. If they do, we will continue to appeal. I am convinced that these men are innocent, and that the jury which convicted them paid no attention to the doctrine of reasonable doubt.""Photo (Clinton White as he spoke to reporters at the start of the Zebra trial one year ago.)","1976",0,1

Elijah Muhammad, and the nature of these changes will be announced on Feb. 29 by his son, W.D. Muhammad, who succeeded his father as Chief Minister of the religious group.Minister Abdul Haleem Farrakhan was in the Bay Area last week, representing Chief Minister Muhammad and offering newsmen a preview of some of the changes. In addition to such already apparent revisions as the liberalizing of dress codes, the more open nature of sect meetings and the admission of whites, Farrakhan revealed that the members of the Nation are now being encouraged to register to vote in elections for the first time.Farrakhan said he hadn't been advised yet whether the Nation will endorse a candidate in the coming presidential elections. But he cautioned the press against underestimating their political influence should they decide to take such a step. ""It would be a mistake to judge the impact of the Muslim vote by just looking at the numbers of Muslims in the country,"" Farrakhan told reporters.He described the Nation of Islam as the ""most organized, disciplined force of Black people in the country,"" and predicted that their political influence would be felt well beyond the confines of their own membership. ""We will no longer merely stand by and watch candidates who don't offer any overall program to benefit Black people"" he said.The move into electoral politics and other changes in Muslim practices are the ""natural outgrowth"" of policies initiated by Hon. Elijah Muhammad prior to his death last February, according to Farrakhan. Most of the movement appears to be a liberalizing of traditional doctrine and practice. Farrakhan described the changes as ""evolutionary, not revoluntionary,"" and characterized their direction in terms of Elijah Muhammad's decision three years ago to stop speaking of white people as ""devils,"" to the present condition where whites are welcomed into the nation and ""treated fantastically,"" in Farrakhan's words. He added that 90 to 95 percent of the national membership approves the new directions.Hon. W.D. Muhammad will officially announce the new directions himself in a speech broadcast to all major U.S. cities via closed-circuit television on February 29. The occassion will be the annual convention of the Nation of Islam marking the first time the American public at large has been invited to participate in Muslim activities.In San Francisco, the convention will be at the Masonic Auditorium, 1111 California Street, beginning at noon.

A group of young aspiring students of modeling who have progressed over the year. These students learn the art of poise, make-up, commercials, and diction. Barbara uses her mother's converted garage as her studio. Earl Young emceed the program in his usual suave and articulate style. Carla Smith, Sherry Davis, and Bridgett Davis did the commentaries. Oscar Preston provided the music. One of the highlights of the show was a wedding dress designed by Bay Area designer Lilli Young, modeled by Marlene Carter.Those models receiving their diplomas, in cap and gown, presented by Earl and Barbara (who, I might add, looked very sharp in a two-piece pinstriped pantsuit accented with a white blouse and with her make-up superbly applied) were Genenne Beasly, Marlene Carter, Kimberly Richard, Tracy Smith, Odell Alice, Celeste Furlough, Jackie Ford, Carla Smith, and Carolyn Gardiner.

"650","Robertson, Gene",1977-02-17,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","AWARD TIME: The first few months of any year have become Awards Time. The Grammys, the Emmys, the Oscars, the Foreign Correspondents' Golden Globe awards, the American Music awards, the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP Chapter's Image Awards, and, well, you name it, and there's probably an award of some kind or another that will fall into the category you choose. Awards have already been made in some of the above-listed categories (viz., the Golden Globe awards and the American Music awards), and the winners (or some of 'em, at least) may find themselves honored again in some of the above-listed categories. For example, not only did Stevie Wonder find himself a double winner in the American Music awards (Best Soul Male Vocalist plus his Songs in the Key of Life being chosen as the favorite soul album), but he has been nominated in the 19th upcoming Grammy Awards on Feb. 19, which will be hosted by Andy Williams and broadcast live from Hollywood. In fact, Stevie Wonder has been nominated in the Grammy's Best R&B vocal performance, male, with his aforementioned Songs in the Key of Life album nominated and a third nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, male, for that album's title song. Lou Rawls is another who has been nominated in two categories. First his ""Groovy People"" has been named in the Best R&B Vocal Performance, male, while his ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" has been nominated for Best Vocal Pop Performance, male, and that means that Wonder and Rawls will be competing against each other in this particular category. And since the Hollywood-Beverly Hills NAACP chapter has not yet announced its nominations (only the date, April 9), it's possible to have more artists pitted against one another. And in trying to enumerate the various awards, I find that I've neglected mentioning still another awards presentation, and that will be the Academy of Country Music Awards, which will air next Thursday, Feb. 24, 11:30 p.m. to 1 a.m., on the ABC network (KGO, Channel 7, locally).NEW TV SHOW TO DEBUT: The mounting criticism of the excessive (and unnecessary) violence on television seems to be having a gradual effect on the major TV outlets: ABC, CBS, and NBC. That complimentary statement is brought about by ABC's announcement that its first family novel for TV, Little Vic, will premiere on KGO, Channel 7, next Monday night, Feb. 21, at 7:30. The show is a six-part novel, which will be seen for six consecutive weeks in February and March. Little Vic stars Joey Green, a 15-year-old native Californian who plays the hero, Gillie Walker, a Harlem-born orphan who is traveling to Kentucky to try to find his grandmother's home but takes refuge in a barn to escape a violent rainstorm. He falls asleep there and, upon awakening the next morning, observes the birth of a thoroughbred colt. Totally entranced, he immediately accepts the job as a stable boy offered him by the farm's owner. From that moment on, Gillie's life is tied up with Little Vic, and Gillie eventually becomes a professional jockey. Though I have only witnessed the premiere segment, I have no hesitancy in recommending Little Vic to audiences of all ages. It was produced by Emmy Award-winning Daniel Wilson, who has been responsible for other award-winning children's shows for ABC.A NEW FILM: Thieves, which costars Marlo Thomas and Charles Grodin and was based on the Broadway hit by Herb Gardner (and with him also responsible for the screenplay), opens this Friday, Feb. 18, at the Cannery Cinema, and Marlo Thomas came to our city last week to talk about the film and many other things except her private life (""The one thing I won't speak about is my private life,"" she emphasized, but admitted that she and writer Gardner were romantically involved (to use a dated and somewhat old-fashioned term). Most TV viewers will, of course, associate Marlo Thomas with the TV series ""That Girl,"" which ran for five years, and film buffs will remember her delightful performance in Jenny. She readily admitted she was ired of the TV series when it went off the air, she toured the college circuit and talked to drama students and left some of the ""That Girl"" scripts for them to study in their drama courses. She then went to London, where she appeared for a year in Barefoot in the Park, and, while calling it a charming play, she also said that it was not what real people are about. Switching the talk to her current film, Thieves, she described it as about a man and woman who, after 12 years of marriage, find themselves unable to communicate. ""We spend so marriage, find themselves unable to communicate. ""We spend so much time talking about tomorrow that no time is given to today,"" she philosophized. She also thinks the films of the 1930s and '40s were far more realistic than most of today's films. She pointed out that she had been too busy on this tour to see any of the new films. ""....but I'd rather go see Rocky than a film about a building burning down.""Photo (WONDER ...award, award, award)","1977",1,0

Jaffee of Columbia and Jeanne Clare Ridley of Georgetown University in the study done at Columbia's Bureau of Applied Social Research.The only solution may be to let people work less for the same pay, the two social scientists believe.They recommend ""either fewer hours per week, or longer vacations per year, or perhaps sabbaticals interspersed through the working life.""Such changes would be a continuation of the long history of reduction in work time, from 60 and 70 hours a week a century ago to less than 40 hours today, the authors note.""The United States is entering a period in which almost the entire adult population, including older teen-agers, will want jobs,"" the sociologists say. ""It will be extremely difficult to provide them. The country is having trouble in 1977 trying to reduce unemployment it will have even more trouble in future years.""By 1990, nearly three-quarters of all women between 20 and 60 will be in the labor force, Jaffe and Ridley forecast. About 18 million more women than now and 12 million more men will be employed or looking for work then. The authors predict that small families and increased college attendance by women will significantly expand the female labor force.Over the same years labor productivity will continue to increase about 2 percent a year, the social scientists project. ""We can expect that by 1990 three workers will be producing as much as four today, thanks to continued development of labor-saving devices and changes in the organization of work,"" the authors predict.And in the same period several million older persons who would rather work than retire will produce a clamor to abolish compulsory retirement.

He said Cahill is in violation of Section 5 of the Affirmative Action plan adopted by the city. This part of the Affirmative Action plan means that a contractor will use every reasonable effort to encourage minority participation.Johnson said Cahill refused to meet with them, preferring to negotiate through City Hall and the Human Rights Commission. ""Furthermore, I was arrested on eight counts of extortion and one count of tampering with a grand jury witness for protesting this discrimination,"" Johnson said. ""I was released on one hundred thousand dollars' bail.""The charges which were trumped up by Cahill, Chef Smith, Ralph Rodgers, and other racist contractors, who have been doing all of the earth and equipment moving, were dismissed,"" he said.He said that a requirement of 50-percent minority participation is what the group is trying for. It is reflective of the racial make-up of the city of San Francisco, which Johnson said is 60-percent minority.Other criticism came from Ken Evans, sales representative of C and T Trucking. He said that one of the problems is that the Human Rights Commission has the job of enforcing affirmative action and has dragged its feet on the matter. He charged that the waste water management program has not even enforced the affirmative action program they have claimed to implement.Attorney Charles Garry said he will file a suit to determine how strong the San Francisco affirmative action program is.

Only the Times, the Daily News, and the Post survive in New York today. The typographical unions killed seven of the big-city dailies through strike action in disputes between the unions and the owners. The owners chose to close down all the other papers.Dan Collins said he had enough, and Goodlett provided the subsidy alone.Goodlett bought a vacant lot on Post Street, near the intersection of Laguna. Some old houses were being relocated by developers from another location. Goodlett bought one of the houses, and for the first time the paper owned its own office building.There was a large basement in the building, which must formerly have housed some commercial business because of the size of the window and the type of door. Goodlett had ideas of growth. So he had a cement floor laid in the basement.By this time we had got our feet well soaked in local politics and were becoming real bushy-tailed about politics. We had persuaded the Rev. Frederick D. Haynes to run for supervisor--in the late 1940s. I believe--and Haynes garnered more than 60,000 votes in a field composed of a dozen or more candidates.The Democratic Party, which was led by William Malone, the county chairman and a onetime state central chairman, promised to support the Black candidate. This was a tough decision for Malone to make, because he was the man who handled national patronage in the Bay Area. Malone had been close to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.Frank Havenner, a liberal, was one of the Democratic members of Congress from California.","1977",0,0

You are bearing children without marriage because you want to, you are making choices between becoming a housewife, a career woman, or both, you're venturing into fields that have been traditionally reserved for men, and you're demanding equal pay for equal work. But now it's time to take one more step-taking charge of your own money.It's not hard when you really think about it. A woman can take $10 and buy dinner for a week if she has to just as she may put aside $5 a week to obtain something she's had her eye on. So why not take some of that money and put it to work for you?There are organizations and businesses across the country that have recently come to the same conclusion, and as a result there are now seminars, workshops, and courses offered that can and do teach women all about investing their money.One such seminar was recently held by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Inc., at I. Magnin's. It was hosted by two Merrill Lynch account executives, Susan Jostad and Ann Janis, and the panel discussion on ""Financial Freedom: Taking the First Step"" was led by investor information specialist Ann Benson Segal.Segal, who directs the Investment Information Center and the Money Tree Exhibit in New York, first became interested in money management some years ago. ""Women have to learn to understand money in order to take charge of their lives. A lot of them invest in art or jewelry, which doesn't always have that resale value, because it may have been bought more because of its attractiveness than because of its investment value. However, stocks can be liquidated for money in an emergency.""Merrill Lynch is offering the first course for women on a large scale. The courses have been happening across the country, and most of them have yielded a lot of success. In some cases many women sign up for the course that teaches one how to become a stock-broker.Investing is not an area you should get into without some research. Segal advises not to put all your eggs in one basket, and don't marry your stock, but set goals for when you want to buy or sell. It is a field that will take time, concentration, and by all means should not be attempted unless your finances are in order, but why not?","1977",1,0

They should have given OCLC the entire day instead of a few hours. But it's difficult to deal in the communications empire. Things are so strategically planned and screened far in advance.

Hollywood's Tina Andrews found out quickly where the industry's head was after her short-lived romance with the ""boy next door"" on the day-time soaps (Racism is alive and quite well.)The media have been real busy eulogizing King Elvis. ""He made Black music respectable to whites,"" remarked a tearful fan. Maybe so, but all his wigglin'-gigglin' (a la Little Richard) to millionaire status profited him an early demise and a life filled with loneliness and constant searching for a life-mate.

The tax which the landlord collects and passes on to the state or local government is not real income for the landlord and is not considered as such under either current law or on the Tenants Tax Justice Bill.

Unless they are natural students or recipients of good advice, they end up with poor marks, unable to get into a large four-year college. If they are exceptional in their athletic endeavors, they are wooed by college coaches who are anxious for their services.About 85 percent find it difficult to pass the entrance requirements of the University of California, Stanford, San Jose or the University of Southern California.Because of the difficulty accompanying entrance into larger institutions far-thinking educators in this state devised the community college system, which allows students and student-athletes the time necessary to adjust to the demands and self-reliance needed to continue their educations.Many San Francisco high school graduates enroll in City College of San Francisco, which allows them ample time in two years to decide what they would like to do without the pressure of competing on the intense level of a bigger school. They can mature scholastically and athletically.Athletes whose grades were below the entrance level of other schools, with proper counseling, can attain standards that will be acceptable at the completion of their studies at City College.Alumni of the small institution located at Ocean Avenue and Phelan Street include O.J. Simpson, who went on to USC. Ollie Matson and Burl Toler who went to USF.

Hector continued.Hector is sympathetic with the talented youngsters because his own humble background has given him the insight on the obstacles facing potential superstars who are not prepared for the competition they will meet.The 38-year-old coach lived in Marin City, the Marin County equivalent of Hunters Point, while attending Mt. Tamalpais High School. He said it wasn't easy going to a school with a lot of students whose parents could afford to send them in their-own cars or limousines. His prowess as an athlete, however, got him a scholarship to the College of Pacific. He got enough recognition at offensive tackle there to prompt the Los Angeles Rams to draft him in 1961. After a brief stint with the Angelenos. he spent the rest of his professional career with the Denver Broncos.He turned to coaching when his playing days ended, he said, because he wanted to help young people.

These athletes, he said, are disillusioned when they return, and it is now up to the City College staff to rebuild the athlete's confidence.For most of them, it is the first time they have been away from home. Hecter said. ""They miss their family and friends, and the coaches don't understand them.""They are close to home here, and we try to help them any way we can, he continued. Also their families get to see them play.A lot of coaches tell them if they come to their schools they will get more aid for the grants given students, he said. ""That's not true because the same programs for assisting a needy student are available at our school as there are at any others.Hector said 17 athletes who competed at the school were given scholarships to four-year colleges in the last year.I think that speaks well of our program, he said.

We know there's a large number of persons who would not enter the place, not even to inspect it as an excellent example of the architecture of a bygone day. But for a large number of elderly persons of Asian descent, it is home, and it has been home to them for a long time.The building was sold to the inevitable developers, who had plans to raze the structure and erect one of those inevitable high-rise office complexes, which would reap handsome profits for them.The residents have waged a long and hard fight to preserve their home--a fight that has raised an unsuspected, but influential, outpouring of sympathy among persons in the city who know how hard it is for a person with low income to find low-income housing.The courts decided in favor of the developers and ordered Sheriff Hongisto to evict all tenants from the International Hotel, their dwelling place. Hongisto, in turn, informed the courts that he did not have the manpower to conduct the eviction. He said that it seemed probable that a riot would ensue during the course of such an eviction. The mass of those who sympathize with the hotel's residents were of fiery tempers--not to be trifled with. The courts held Hongisto in contempt of a court order, and he was sentenced to serve five days in the San Mateo County Jail.Hongisto is a rare breed of young man, who has always evinced an inordinate store of compassion for other human beings who have been the victims of all forms of discrimination, whether that discrimination has been overt or covert. His concern for the underprivileged has earned him the plaudits of all fair-minded persons, not only in San Francisco but throughout the nation.We hope that the residents of the International Hotel have been duly impressed by the action of this dedicated public servant who took the position of giving up his freedomn for human rights rather than plod along, performing his daily chores. He could have taken the easy way out, placing the earning of profits ahead of a compassion for his fellows, and he'd never have had to worry about serving even a day in captivity.","1977",1,1

Much of the substance of the matter has been lost amid these cliches and code words.In this process. Allan Bakke has been depicted as an honor student with great qualifications who was denied entry to the U.S.-Davis Medical School because less-qualified Blacks and minorities were admitted.Not once did I hear or read that eleven other medical schools had also refused Bakke's admittance, including his alma mater. Minnesota. One would have to assume that Minnesota would know him best, since he had spent four years there. Yet they denied him, as did the ten other schools. Therefore there was agreement with the decision of the admissions committee at Davis by other distinguished universities from around the country.The judge who ruled in Bakke's favor still said that Bakke had not established the fact that he would have been admitted if there was no special admissions program. In fact, the record clearly shows that 35 white students would have been admitted ahead of Bakke even if there were no special admissions program. Yet the media have never mentioned this.There were at least eight white students who were admitted to the Davis Medical School who had lower benchmark scores than Bakke and 36 whites who had lower grade point averages. Bakke did not choose to challenge those admissions. The news media haven't pointed that out.Bakke was presented as an honor student by the media. He had a grade point average of 3.51. Some of the minority students who were admitted had grade point averages as high as 3.76. Yet the media depicted them as inferior in achievement.Bakke could have applied under the special admissions program himself but chose not to. One hundred eleven white students sought admission under the program. The media never mentioned that.A major reason for Bakke's being turned down was his age. He had written the officials at Davis about his age, and they had informed him that his age would be a factor. The media skillfully avoided mentioning this, although they were aware of exchanges of letters between Bakke and the university.The mass media of America, by projecting Bakke as highly qualified, when in fact he is only marginally qualified, by stereotyping the minority students as misfits and failures, by using code words, such as ""reverse discrimination case,"" ""quotas,"" and others, clearly aided and abetted the cause of Bakke. They skillfully manipulated a case against the minorities as unqualified people wanting something for nothing.This blatant misrepresentation and slant reporting on the part of the mass media of America are frightening precedents. With all the grave questions that confront us as we grapple with the eminent demands of our times, we cannot tolerate the news media as out foes. They are powerful and have a massive impact on the minds of the people.This is a danger. While we have no controls over the print media, we can do something about the broadcast media. Technically and legally the airwaves belong to the people. We only lease the various frequencies to the radio and television stations that utilize them.

"683","Berkley, Tom",1977-12-14,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","BAKKE CASEThe following article by Alfred B. Fitt, a Washington, D.C. attorney, is I feel the best piece written about the Bakke case thus far. I urge Post Readers to clip and save this article which will run in three parts in the POST. The article is reprinted from the October 1977 issue of Change.In Search OF A Just Outcome by Alfred B. FittIn 1972 Allan Bakke, an American male of Scandinavian stock, applied for admission to 2 medical schools; and the next year he applied to 11 more. All 13 turned him down. In 1974 he tried again at 1 of the 13--the University of California at Davis--and was turned down for the fourteenth time. Unable to satisfy any medical school admissions committee, Bakke looked to the California courts for help and found it. The Supreme Court of California has ordered his admission at Davis, an order not yet in effect, but the University has appealed to the United States Supreme Court.Since it is clearly not the ordinary business of judges to decide who gets into medical school, it follows that the California judges thought there was something extraordinary about the Bakke case. The singular feature they dentified was ""reverse discrimination""--favoritism for minorities at the expense of the white majority. They found as a fact that Bakke was better qualified than 16 minority applicants preferentially admitted at Davis in 1973, and they decided that race was an unacceptable basis for departing from the University's presumed duty to admit in order of relative marit. The essence of the California Supreme Court decision is in the following passages:The ends sought by such (preferential) programs are clearly just if the benefit to minorities is viewed in isolation. But there are more forceful policy reasons against preferential admissions based on race. The divisive effect of such preferences needs no explication... The overemphasis upon race as a criterion will undoubtedly be counterproductive;... Pragmatic problems are certain to arise in identifying groups which should be preferred or in specifying their numbers, and preferences once established will be difficult to abolish:... Perhaps most important, the principle that the Constitution sanctions racial discrimination against a race--any race--is a dangerous concept fraught with potential for misuse....To uphold the University would call for the sacrifice of principle for the cake of dubious expediency.... The safest course, the one-most consistent with the fundamental interests of all races and with the design of the Constitution, is to hold, as we do, that the special admissions program is unconstitutional because it violates the rights guaranteed to the majority by the equal protection clause.Who wants to ""sacrifice principle for the sake of dubious expediency""? Jampacking a judicial opinion with glittering generalities is one way of concealing the emptiness of the analysis underlying the opinion. The rendingly difficult issues presented by the Bakke case demand far more thoughtful and dispassionate treatment than they received from the California court.It is beyond argument that the responsibility for establishing educational policy at the University of California and its many campuses is lodged in the regents in general and in the several faculties in particular, with the legislature playing the role of lawmaking and funding overlord. Within the policies so established, it is the University--not the legislature, the governor, or the courts that must decide who may be admitted when not all can be admitted. That the people of California, like the people of the other states, have vested such responsibility in their University does not ensure that the resulting admissions policies and decisions will be the wisest, or the best, or free of ""divisive effects"" or of the ""potential for misuse."" Universities, like other kinds of institutions, can and do stumble. However, it is not the business of judges to stop a university from stumbling, or to supervise the wisdom of its decision. But it is their business to stop a state university from acting unjustly--if indeed it has been unjust, and if some plaintiff is troubled enough to start a lawsuit.That is, of course, exactly what Allan Bakke did in 1974. But in ruling in his favor, the California Supreme Court chose only to substitute its policy judgment for that of the regents and the faculty at the Davis campus. The court failed to ask, and therefore did not answer, the one question properly its business to examine. Did the University of California treat Allan Bakke unjustly?Where one stands depends on where on sits. From where Bakke sits, he clearly has been done an injustice. He had very good undergraduate grades and scores on the national Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), much better than the average of accepted applicants at Davis and better than any of the 16 racially favored matriculants. By the ""benchmark rating"" compiled at Davis itself--an aggregate score given by five admissions reviewers to every promising applicant, with each reviewer placing a single numerical value on grades and test scores plus his impressions of the applicant's character, compassion enthusiasm, and similar unmeasurable qualities--Bakke probably ranked above all 16 of those specially admitted. (Applicants for special admission in 1973 were rated by six rather than fivereviewers and against each other rather than against the entire applicant pool, so their benchmark ratings were not truly comparable to Bakke's. But if his were simply divided by five and their by six, his resulting rating was higher than any given the sixteen.)For all his high grades, impressive MCAT scores, and excellent benchmark rating from the Davis admissions reviewer Bakke lost out, did not even make the waiting list, while 16 people with lower grades, lower MCAT scores, and putatively lower benchmark ratings were admitted--because they were black or Chicano or Asian-American. This was unfair, claimed Bakke, so unfair as to be unjust, a denial of the equal protection guaranteed him by the Constitution.Bakke won his lawsuit in California because he managed to portray the case as one in which he a white person, was somewhere among the eighty-fifth through one hundredth places in a long queue of nearly 3,000 people, ordered by proven merit; lined up to enter a first-year class of 100 in a state medical school, when suddenly 16 people behind him were moved to the head of the line because of their color, and the admissions door was shut before his turn was reached. The constitutional effect, the California judges concluded, was no different from a case in which a black person among the first 16 found himself passed over for no other reason that his blackness. So viewed, it is hard to disagree with the California ruling in Bakke's favor.Yet there is the other side. After all, Bakke did not simply lose out at Davis. He was rejected on 12 other medical schools as well and this surely must give his champions some pause. Among the 12 were 2 other University of California medical schools, which like Davis were actively seeking to increase the numbers of minority physicians. The one at San Francisco took 22 percent for its 1973 entering class (against 16 percent at Davis), and that at Los Angeles enrolled 12 percent that year. But among the other institutions that turned Bakke down were Georgetown (4 percent minority matriculants in 1973), Mayo (4 percent). Wayne State (7 percent). Cincinnati (8 percent), and South Dakota (0 percent). It is clear that Bakke was not crowded out by minority candidates everywhere.In fact it is not clear that minorities crowded Bakke out anywhere. Probably what did him in was his age. Bakke was born in 1940, so in 1973 he was 10 or 11 years older than the typical medical school freshman, and he would have been in his early forties before completing his training. Medical school alone--not counting the years of specialty training that follow--costs society about $125,000 per graduate. When there are many more able applicants than can be accepted, most medical schools prefer to take those with the prospect of practicing 40 years over those with an expectancy of less than 30. There is a time and a tide in every man's life, not every belated change of mind can of should be accommodated.Even given Bakke's competence and the admirable stubborness of his quest for an MD, a sympathy for his disappointment should not be converted into an order for his admission to medical school. If a place is made for him (and he will be 38 before this now could happen), some other able, attractive, determined, and presumably younger candidate must be turned away. We will not know his name, and he will not know what hit him, but it is undeniable that Bakke's admission would mean only a shifting of his disappointment to some other living, yearning, worthy human being.","1977",0,1

So we started the drill team.""Tolbert said, ""We first began with a group of thirteen. However, half of them moved within the first year. So it was necessary to rebuild. Many of those in the group saw us practicing and became interested in the group, and some of them eventually became members.""Because of the lack of money the group has found it difficult to obtain uniforms, Tolbert said.

He immediately contracted to air their performance on television.The group can be seen practicing in several areas of the Western Addition every Monday and Thursday. The group ranges in age from seven to 15. Tolbert said she has a four-year-old who comes to the practice sessions but won't allow her to become part of the group until she reaches five years of age.Tolbert said the name Eskalite came from ""Escalator,"" which moves in an escalating manner Although she said there are no requirements for a girl to become a member of the Eskalites. Tolbert requires all members in the group to work hard so they too will escalate ""upward and onward.""Tolbert does not feel the routines are hard to learn, in spite of the fact that many of them look like a work of art. Tolbert said the group constantly makes up their own routines; most of the new girls pick up the routines in about a day.Tolbert said the group plans to hold a series of fund-raising activities, such as white elephant sales, and hold variety shows in hopes of raising money to pay for many of their supplies and their transportation expenses.

Bill Cartwright was incapacitated. He broke his arm in a pickup game shortly before the season began.Nevertheless, the Dons, with highflying, James Hardy, 6-9 center forward, manning Cartwright's position in his absence, made a shambles of the opposition.For starters Hardy and company trounced the Idahoans in their opening-round battle. 109-70. The win was USF's fifth in sixth starts. The Dons, paced by torrid-shooting Winford Boynes (16-for-22) for a career high of 36 points, had too much fire power for Idaho's club laden with freshmen and sophomores.Baylor edged UOP in overtime 88-87, for the dubious distinction of being the sacrificial lambs the next evening.The Texans, however, relished their underdog role and put forth their best effort, almost nipping the host team in a hotly contested shootout.When the smoke cleared around burning nets in Memorial Gymnasium, USF had prevailed, 98-93, but Gaillard was breathing a sigh because time had run out.Baylor unleashed sharpshooter Vinnie Johnson, who broke the Memorial Gymnasium record with 43 points (former record of 41 was held by Gaillard, set in 1962), and he almost shot the Dons out onto Golden Gate Avenue.At one time during the first half, USF led the Bears by 11 points.

The ubiquitous Johnson then outscored the Dons b points to 2, to tie the score at 90-all.Ultimately it was the Dons' superior talent that prevailed over Baylor's one-man gang. It was, however, the kind of game that fans who were there will talk about for weeks to come.Baylor's Johnson impressed the media so much with his talent that he was voted the Most.

Immediately following the performance there was an after-party with the cast to benefit the NAACP Joe Hall, who is the S.F. chapter's president, looked most handsome in his black tux. Joe was busy seeing that everything went as planned.Opening night read like a Who's Who list. I noticed and chatted with many of the well-dressed first-nighters.Accompanying me was the dynamic Emmit Powell, who is busy these days preparing for his National Gospel Awards program, to be held Oct. 9 at the Civic Auditorium. Mineola Jackson was elated because her niece, Tenaj Davis, was in the show, performing as one of the dancers in several scenes. I later met Tenaj at the after-party.Man-all-about-town Donald Ray Young introduced me to his date. Nicol Williams. Ray Taliaferro, of Channel 4, was seen chatting in the lobby. SR's News editor, Peter Magnani, and his lovely wife, Diane, were there, as was Idaree Westbrook, who was musing over her upcoming trip to the nation's capital for the Black Caucus meeting to be held this week. John Douimbia, of the NAACP, was busy conversing with everyone. Cocoa Walther, columnist for Happenings, looked rather striking in his white dinner jacket. He introduced Emmit and me to singer Roosevelt Winchester, who performs with a group called Essence. The exciting Jim Harvey was greeting everyone in the lobby, Jim was the PR man for the NAACP benefit, doing all the press releases and handling the many arrangements involved with the event.I noticed the fabulous Gerri Lange, of Channel 9's ""Woman-time"" program. She was conversing with friends in the lobby; later she introduced me to her attractive son, Michael. Gerri looked exceptionally lovely. The chic Hazel Davis, of Black Women of Action, seemed to be enjoying the evening. She will be busy with Ella Hutch's campaign for supervisor in District 4. I bumped into Brenda Brodie, advertising manager for the Sun Reporter The Clift Hotel's doorman of distinction George Coleman introduced me to his delightful daughter, Dana Coleman and her companion, Eric Forrest.The ever-pleasant Jack Kisbey, of the NAACP, was on hand at the entrance to Channel 44's lobby. The party was held in one of the huge rooms. Kisbey greeted the guests as they arrived. One of the first persons I ran into at the party was Henry Jones, of Henry's Haven on Diviz. He introduced me to Raymond Lee, Katherine Nash and her sister-in-law. Virginia Williams, and Virginia's sister, Regina Williams. Henry wanted me to be sure to wish B. and Johnny a happy silver anniversary....May you both make the golden one.Also on the scene were Carl Purifoy, Mercedes LaFlue, Ruth Curl, Annette Cooper, SR's Gene Robertson, and Walter Mallory. The daughter-in-law of Dr. Carlton Goodlett, Carolyn Goodlett, who is learning the business angles of newspaper publishing, a very pleasant and pretty lady, was there, too. Also enjoying the evening were George Newkirk, of the Black Leadership Forum, and Gertrude Mays, of the Black Teachers Caucus.Members of the cast mingled with the guests. I was disappointed that I did not get to meet Renee Harris, the Dorothy of The Wiz, for she did not arrive while I was there. All was not lost, for I met Ruth Ashton, one of the dancers, and Carolyn Miller, who plays the Witch of the West in The Wiz. In the midst of a group of guests who were cracking their sides was the man who was the cause of all their uproar, Ken Prymus, who plays the role of the Cowardly Lion. Ken manifested a good sense of humor. I realized why he was cast for his particular part. The brother is really down to earth. Emmit invited him and the cast down for some soul food at his own restaurant, Powell's Place.Also on the scene were Jim White and Oscar Easley, of the Emmit Powell Productions Company. The gentlemen have been busy obtaining sponsors for Emmit's TV show to be aired soon on Channel 20, with yours truly as his co-host.One of the swingingest Virgos in town, Howard Johnson, invited me and his many friends to keep up the pace and swing with him on a Saturday night at Freedom West's reception room. Well, I had to get my act together and move fast to relax amid the harmonious vibrations that were going down. Their many friends turned the mother out! The dapper Mr. Johnson and his fine-looking wife, Elaine, were dressed alike in green coveralls and blending shirts. They had their act together, and I'm telling you I had not seen so much food at one party since I made it over to Cliff Whatley's house about two Christmases ago. Dig. Lady Elaine and her friends put the pots on the burners, and, when they started cooking, they were not jiving.The hip crowd was keeping up with the pace that the DJ was setting, and they were doing it! Many of the avid 49er fans stopped by after the losing game (I gave my tickets to Winston Hall and Larry Custus). Among them were Bob Lewis, of Park Vista, Lionel Fennel, and Bennie Holmes, who looked sporty in his dark red two-piece suit and black leather jacket. I'm told his annual picnic, which I missed, was a great success. I had not seen Bill and Juanita Cooper in quite some time. They were both dressed very sharp.The baaad Mr. Ben Flemings and his lady were getting down on the dance floor...His lady had the body language down pat....I imagined Ben saying, ""Talk to me!"" Sensuous Frankie Alex was letting her torso talk to her man, Bernard Merritt, of Jack's. The lady was shaking up the area in her white, skin-tight halter-length gown. She had the east, west, south, and north covered...Bernard's expression seemed to say, ""Baby, work on me."" Also on the scene were Howard's nieces, Camilla Carpenter and Dr. Barbara Calhoun.Little Joe Turner was doing his thing, as was his petite ex-wife (a surprise to me!), Frances Turner, whom I did not recognize because of the chic hairstyle she was wearing. Ladies, it was super baaad! The beautiful red cut was colored and styled by coiffeuse Tyler Mae Allen, entrepreneuse of Post Street Barber Shop. She styles the hair of many of the elite gentlemen about town, Pretty Ms. Frances is the manicurist and pedicurist at the barber shop.One of the neatest kats about town, and a beautiful dude, Roy Guillory, was spreading his good cheer. George Dossett and his attractive lady, Kay Stone, were there. The 13 Charms' sexy president, Charmaine Lewis, looked captivating in her outfit (the charming 13 ladies will be partying on the Bay this Saturday). I saw all these there, too. Jennie Conyers, Clara Jackson, of Jack's, handsome Donald ""Doc"" Seals, Vicky Winston, Sam Bennet, Florence Epps, Rangatang and his foxy lady, Joyce Williams, Joe and Mary Wilson, Fred Williams, Junior Elliot, Earl the Pearl and his provocative lady, Gerri Reed (the Pearl is partying back east with his buddies Freddie Jett, of the Pied Piper, and Jerry Edwards, of the Flying Fox, both of L.A.). The Pearl introduced me to two ladies visiting from L.A. and both of the USN, Lillie White and Valarie Lyle.Ed ""Broadway"" Bradley gave an after-party for those who wanted to continue partying after the midnight curfew at Freedom West; the smooth Mr. Duke, bartender of the Hideaway, looked really fine, Al Brown, of Park Vista, Duke and Jimmye Bynum, who were dressed alike in white suits, Pete Smith, Sarah Cooper, and jazz pianist Jackie Strong, the golfing gentlemen--Clyde Hollie and Clint Smith; James Roberts, of Jack's and his charming wife, Joyce...a very warm couple. Everybody gave it up and got down on the seemingly never-ending Got to Give it Up. Howard and Elaine are noted for their way-out parties, and this one fulfilled everyone's expectations...Again, Happy Birthday, Howard...I hope you feel as young as you look.Well, September marks the first anniversary of ""I Heard That,"" and, to celebrate, I will be hosting an anniversary party at Park Vista on Sunday, Oct. 16...So keep the date in mind (although I won't let you forget it). Many of the L.A. set will be coming up to help me celebrate.Rare Essence...rare, meaning unusual or unique, and essence, meaning, being, soul, life. Put it all together, and you have 12 enchanting ladies who radiate the meaning of Rare Essence. Join me this Sunday, Sept. 25, after the games, in an evening with Rare Essence, to be held at Park Vista from 5 until 11 p.m.Hey, it's nice to be nice, and to all of you out there....Look for me....I'll be there....","1977",0,0
"698","Cook, Winfred",1977-08-18,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Q. I haven't been to a beauty salon in years. I had a terrible experience with a permanent hair straightener. All my hair fell out! I've been understandably leery of ""professional"" beauty salons ever since. Have things changed at all?A. I would like to think times have changed completely, but too often, even today, people misuse hair care/cosmetic products. Chemical hair straighteners, for instance, are of a much better quality nowadays, and yet many of my new customers come to me with the same horror stories I've been hearing for years. This can only mean human error or abuse.Remember, these products are cosmetics. They cannot (nor should you want them to) permanently after the texture of your hair. Professionals or laymen who do not recognize this fact are literally playing with fire (remember, the way your scalp feels when a relaxer has been left on too long). I do believe in the use of chemical relaxers. Properly used, they can be as much fun and as safe to use as eyeshadow or any other favorite cosmetic.Q. How do you feel about the new electrical hair appliances, especially the steam rollers?A. As far as electric rollers are concerned. I think they may be used with some degree of success by most people as long as proper caution and good sense are exercised. Remember, the less you do to your hair, the better. Most women roll their hair too often. and this a) causes breakage and b) is usually not necessary for a lasting curl. If you shampoo and set your hair once a week, I think weekly or biweekly touch-ups with your curlers are all you should need to maintain most styles. If you find you need them more often, your style has probably grown out and a haircut may be in order. This will also eliminate any split ends caused by too frequent use of any hair appliance.","1977",0,0

A major subscription campaign figures largely in the plan. BERKELEY STAGE is a young, yet energetic and serious company with an eye to the future. Aside from stabilizing their artistic and administrative endeavors they hope to include the establishment of a second performing stage. BERKELEY STAGE is realizing success and hopes through their continued subscription drives to be able to provide entertainment for an even wider audience.OAKLAND ENSEMBLE THEATRE, Oakland, was granted $30,000 to aid in its seasonal productions. OAKLAND ENSEMBLE is the principal center for Black and multi-ethnic theatre in the Bay Area and their success is mounting, evidenced by some 15,000 persons who attended performances last year. Under the direction of Ron Stacker Thompson, OAKLAND ENSEMBLE will open its fourth season this year with six major productions.O.E.T. has been able to vary their material from experimental efforts to established works, making the ENSEMBLE one of the most exciting theatre companies in the Bay Area.EAST BAY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS, begun in 1969 as the East Bay Music Center by Richmond citizens, was granted $27,000. EBCPA teaches music, dance, theatre, and visual media to interested persons of all ages through group or private, free or near-free instruction. The growth of the CENTER has been phenomenal and, because of this, most of the grant will be used to develop and implement a program for the recruitment and training of volunteers for their office. The program the CENTER offers is very important, for without it, few youngsters in the East Bay would have an exposure to the arts.","1977",0,0
"703","Fields, Ann E",1977-10-12,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Religion and rock music, was not even considered a combination twenty years ago. Skeptics said never.Today, several years after the initial success of the rock opera, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", which is on its way to becoming a theatrical classic, people have accepted the controversial combination.Besides being an avant-garde musical, Jesus Christ Superstar has brought fame and fortune to many of its cast members.Ted Neeley, who portrayed the title role of Jesus of Nazareth, and Carl Anderson who plays the role of Judas, the disciple who betrayed Him, are JSC beneficiaries.Two actors, in the Bay Area to do the production at the Concord Pavilion, have been playing their respective roles for a long time. And yet, they still express excitement over the musical.Neeley bears a striking resemblance to pictures of his Biblical source, so much so, that one must resist the temptation to kneel in his presence. Although he has played the part umpteen times, he said he still loves it and each performance is a new experience.The actor feels that he must have direct contact with his audience so while performing, he said, he constantly cuffs the light from his eyes so he can see directly into the eyes of people in the audience.Anderson expressed equal enthusiasm about the production.He spoke of the ritual that the company performs each night. Before each performance, he said, the cast joins together in a circle grasping hands. They receive each other's vibrations. From that point on they are no longer Carl Anderson or Ted Neeley, but Jesus and Judas.Anderson has strong concerns about television. He feels that it is destroying itself because of its limitations. Black actors have to be more responsible for roles they except, he said, and he has turned down many roles he felt were negative portrayals of Black people.Both actors concurred that the average performer seldom gains from stardom, financially or otherwise. Anderson cited Elvis Presley as an example.Although they indicated they enjoyed doing the television production of the rock opera, as Ted put it. ""It takes away from the production when you cut to an alcaselzer commercial"". If they had their rathers they would do a straight 90 minute production with commercials at the beginning and the end only.The Southern born actors, presently living in Los Angeles did not start as stage performers. Neeley is a drummer for a musical group and Anderson is a jazz singer. Because of their abilities in these arts they were able to transfer easily into a rock production.The two actors appear to have themselves together in terms of who they are and what they want out of life. Anderson said, ""If I die today I'll feel good about my life."" Neeley said, people are concerned with trying to find peace of mind, ""but it has to come from here"", pointing to his self.Neeley has just finished a pilot for a series where he will star as a motorcycle rider, who is an undercover police officer. He recently filmed a guest role in the T.V. series ""Man from Atlantis"" and a CBS-TV special called ""Rolling Stone Review"".He has appeared on numerous programs such as the Tonight Show. The Midnight Special. The Mike Douglas Show, Sonny and Cher and an NBC special with Ray Charles.Anderson has an equally impressive line of accomplishments. One accomplishment in his life that he is extremely proud of is he will soon be a father.Besides anticipating fatherhood, he is continuing his solo singing career. He is currently working on an album.In Hollywood, he is currently appearing at the Improvisation Theatre in ""The Quality of Mercer,"" a review of Johnny Mercer's music. He is also working on a Walt Disney Productions-animated cartoon ""Fox and Hounds"". He has just recently finished costarring with Gilbert Roland in the ""Black Pearl"" which was filmed on location in Malta, Spain and New York City.Jesus Christ Superstar will open at the Concord Pavilion, starting the two actors, October 20 and will continue through October 28.Photo (Carl Anderson)","1977",0,0

"705","Berkley, Tom",1977-12-28,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","-- THE YEAR THAT WAS1977 has come and but for a few days has gone here at 630-20th Street, the building and the nerve center of the Alameda Publishing Corporation and its six allied newspapers.The building is more, however than just the home of the POST Group of newspapers. It houses, for those who are unaware, the law Offices of BERKLEY & RHODES, an urban and rural law firm with offices in Fremont and Oakland, the Carter's Printing Company, a job printing shop and the Norman Spauling Property Management Company.We here at 630-20th Street like to believe this complex of buildings located here at the northend of 20th Street (Financial Row in Oakland) is a center that makes an economic and social statement for all of the diverse groups of Oakland to see. For here truly is the complete integrated program which gives testimony to the affirmative action philosophy that State and Federal administrations seek to emulate.Of the hundred or more people who make up the personnel of our racial composition is approximately 40 percent Blacks, 30 percent whites, and 30 percent Latins. We believe this is as it should be.In short, 1977 has been a banner year. The bottom line, as they say in the financial trades, of all of our operations has been in the black. But what has been more important, the enterprises have solidified and matured both in personnel and in performance (there is a comfortable feeling) too that the challenges lying ahead can be met with a reasonable degree of certainty and excitement. On a day to day basis, we here feel an ever growing responsibility to aid Oakland in remaining a viable, alive and competitive city. A city that is willing to accept the responsibility of caring for its own and to make whatever sacrifices necessary to establihs itself as an example city. A city whose population represents the diverse peoples of this State.Speaking personally the year has been an acceptable one. The early part of the year Mrs. Berkley and I traveled to Washington to participate in the inauguration of Jimmy Carter as President. We then went to New York to spend a week visiting friends and shopping. During the course of the year we had an occasion to revisit Cuba along with a Jazz group that performed in the National Theatre there under the auspices of the Government. Later in the year we made a trip to Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul and Hong Kong, and was fascinated by the life-style of the people of south-east Asia. It was extremely enlightening and educational to make a comparison of the Chinese as against the Japanese.At the year's end a trip was made to Vancouver, Canada, on business. We rounded out our international travel by spending a week in our favorite city Mexico City. We have many friends there and are always happy to mix business with pleasure in what I feel is the most delightful city in the Western Hemisphere.Extensive changes were made in the building at 630-20th Street during 1977. We are very pleased with the new entrance on 20th Street. The entrance carries a theme of the middle-east in colors, decor and appointments. It was designed by Mrs. Berkley. The work was done by Robert Berkley, my brother, the general contractor. Extensive work was done on all the entrances on all three floors of the building. The third floor, where the executive offices of the POST are housed, and where I hold forth along with some of the lawyers of the firm, the development around the atrium, a large sky-lite area some day will compete with the entrance for splendor and elegance. We are proud of our development here and let this stand as an invitation to those who would like to come and see what we are all about.Fifteen years ago when we started the POST Newspaper, our slogan was ""watch us grow."" 1978 will be a year in which this slogan will be apropos, for this bids fare to be a real growth year. If we were to accept a theme for the year it would be a theme to impart to the minorities in this city that their salvation lies within the framework of their own effort. Looking for Governmental handouts and solicitations from the white power group is not the salvation for the readers of this paper. Your salvation rests in your own efforts, your dedication and directly to the degree that you are willing to make personal sacrifices to move you and yours ahead. Underlying this effort should be a re-dedication and a re-evaluation of your own personal worth, trusting your fellow comrades with the realization that without these basic racial thrusts, blacks and brown peoples of this city and for that matter, this state, can never make any substantial progress.Happy New Year.","1977",1,0

"707","",1977-09-01,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The mission of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young and of British Foreign Secretary David Owen to present the U.S.-British peace plan on Rhodesia was destined to be an exercise in futility.The presidents of the five front-line Black nations and the National Front for Liberation of Zimbabwe rejected the plan, because Young's and Owen's proposal involves the incorporation of Black guerrillas with white Rhodesia's military forces as the nucleus of a U.N. force to police the transition to Black rule in Rhodesia. Blacks rejected the proposal, insisting that any transitional military force should consist of Black guerrillas on the one hand, while lan Smith and South Africa's John Vorster rejected the plan, and demanded that a transitional military force should be composed solely of white Rhodesians.The formula presented by Young and Owen was somewhat like passing a camel through the eye of a needle. The whites of Rhodesia and South Africa are determined not to transfer power--political or economic--peacefully to any group of Rhodesian Blacks other than conservative Blacks inside Rhodesia who will serve as a facade protecting white economic power, first, and delegating Blacks pseudo-political power. The National Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe knows that only the force of arms and bloodshed will establish Black control of Rhodesia.Knowledgeable persons recognize that Young and Owen, minions of the industrial West, are attempting to save the capitalist West and its neocolonialism in Black southern Africa. The racism that exists in Rhodesia, Namibia, and South Africa is the most insidious and determined form of white racism that exists anywhere in the world. Young and Owen are trying to temporize and delay the inevitable bloodshed that Rhodesian Black guerrillas and the five Black front-line presidents know is necessary to rid, first Southern Rhodesia, then Namibia, and finally South Africa itself, of the evils of apartheid and white racism.The activities of Andy Young in Black southern Africa are a transparent scheme of the Carter Administration to immobilize Black America's support of the apparently inevitable racial war long brewing and daily becoming more necessary for the destruction of apartheid and its myth of white superiority in these troubled lands of southern Africa. Black Americans must see through this nefarious role that Andy Young plays in this peace-dance minuet. Twenty-six million Blacks must clearly understand that U.N. Ambassador Young does not represent the same constituency in the 1970s that civil rights activist Andy Young represented in the 1960s. Young is one of the few U.S. Blacks who are members of the Trilateral Commission, the creation of David Rockefeller to win the Third World nations and their raw materials for the industrial West. The Trilateral Commission, therefore, opposes the gravitation of the Third World to the Communist forces in the presently covert, worldwide capitalist-versus-Communist struggle, which could at any time break out into a hot-war confrontation.Since Black Americans demand justice, the destruction of apartheid, and a ""one-man one-vote"" majority rule in Black southern Africa. Blacks must be led by other spokesmen to counteract Andy Young's nonsense. The sooner that U.S. Blacks recognize this move in the direction of consolidating their position on the side of the international forces struggling for world peace, then and only then can our moral position be sustained and a unified Black crusade be mounted against what Andy Young and the Carter Administration are doing to support U.S. multinational corporations against the basic aspirations of millions of Black Americans and Black Africans to prevent the blood bath that seemingly becomes more inevitable.","1977",0,1

Townsend, one of the Coast Guard's highest ranking Black officers, drew to a close September 30th. LCDR Townsend ended a five-year tour of duty as Administrative Officer of the Dispensary at the Coast Guard Training Center, Alameda, California.Townsend, a Cleveland, Ohio, native, enlisted in the Coast Guard after graduation from Central Senior High School of Cleveland in 1946. Following basic training at the now-closed Recruit Training Center at Mayport, Florida, he attended Pharmacist's Mate School. Upon graduation in June 1947, Townsend sewed on the red cross designator of a third class Pharmacist's Mate.""Like most youngsters, I had a rough time adjusting to discipline and organization,"" remembers LCDR Townsend. One of his early assignments was to Loran Station Kwadak in the Marshall Islands. ""It was too lonely, had too many mosquitoes, and was too not. I itched all the time,"" he recalls. ""I was just plain miserable.""Later assignments proved more enjoyable for LCDR Townsend. He spent two years assigned to the Public Health Service Hospital in Detroit. Here he served as Coast Guard Representative. This was the beginning of a move into hospital administration which eventually led to him hanging up his stethoscope forever.His most rewarding tour of duty was with the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, between 1961 and 1964. ""I was instrumental in the planning of the new hospital there. I was also in charge of all medical supplies and equipment. If I had died suddenly, they wouldn't have been able to find anything."" Townsend, by then a Hospital Corpsman Chief Petty Officer, regrets that he was unable to sail aboard the USCGC Eagle, the Coast Guard's three-masted barque. ""I helped to supply her for each Cadet Cruise, but I wasn't an operating room technician or a doctor. That was the only way I could have gone.""LCDR Townsend says that he has experienced few problems as a Black Coast Guard officer. ""By the time I became an officer, I had been around the Coast Guard for a number of years. There were a few small problems, but I learned to just ignore the little things that might have affected me negatively. I mostly just took care of my own affairs.""""In 1968, I was appointed as the first Civil Rights Counselor for the 12th Coast Guard District. I saw things then that couldn't be forgotten. I must have stepped on some toes,"" he continues, ""because I was told a number of time that I was taking my job too seriously.""With Coast Guard service over, LCDR Townsend plans to retire in Richmond, California, and begin a business selling home care products.Photo (Lieutenant Commander Antonnealle G.

The brief has been undergoing constant revision by high government officials since it was first drafted by the Justice Department's solicitor general several weeks ago.Early reports had indicated that the administration's brief was noncommittal on the question of affirmative action enrollments in the nation's professional schools. But a report in last Monday's New York Times indicated that the brief up to that point clearly favored Allan Bakke's contention that the special needs of minority applicants should not be considered in determining who gets into school and who does not.Canson chided the solicitor general, a Black attorney named Wade McCrea, for advising Carter against taking a firm anti-Bakke stand. ""Despite advice from some of your Black appointees in the Justice Department,"" Canson told the President, ""we urge you to think of the many young Blacks you will hurt. The impact of this struggle is being felt, not only in education, but in employment and economic development as well.""Canson told the Sun Reporter she believes the impact of the Bakke case has not been felt as strongly in the eastern part of the country as it has in the West, where courts have been deciding affirmative action cases conservatively ever since the California state Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bakke's claims of ""reverse discrimination"" last year. She cited contractors, labor unions, municipal employers, and others who have launched successful attacks against affirmative action programs in the wake of the Bakke decision. The situation will get even worse if the nation's high court rules in Bakke's favor, Canson warned.She asked the President, ""Will you crush our dreams by coming down on the side of Allan Bakke?""","1977",0,1
"711","Weekes, Berry",1977-10-12,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","NO BLACK POP PIANIST...This information I received Sunday night from a very up and coming concert-jazz pianist. After working the entire weekend on the new insert for the Post Newspaper on fine dining and entertainment, I decided to relax a little with some music. Just then my doorbell rang, and it was my next door friend and neighbor, William (Wild Bill) Davis, Regional vice-president of the Western Region for Montgomery Ward. ""Berry, how have you been? You are a hard guy to catch. You are never home,"" he stated. ""I plan to be around this weekend, how's about us having dinner this week? I said, ""Great, friend."" At the same time the phone rang. It was another neighbor asking me to join her for an after dinner drink of Amaretto at the Rusty Scupper. Later, as we were heading back to Park Bellevue, we stopped at Ivey's for another Amaretto. During our stay; I heard some beautiful piano music coming from the dining room. I asked Fred Ivey, the name of the pianist, and he said ""come I'll introduce you to him."" It was then that I met Ricardo (Ricky) Scales, the up and coming young pianist. ""There are no Black Pop Pianists around, and that's my goal,"" stated the young giant.PETER NERO, ROGER WILLIAMS, TO NAME TWO... ""Berry, these are my idols. They play the kind of music, classic, jazz, and light-operatic that appeals to me."" Then Ricky played his composition of 'Till,' semi-classic, jazzy and pop, which was just breathtaking, exquisite and tonal color elegance. ""My, God, man, where did you learn to play like that,"" I asked. ""San Francisco State, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and I'm soon to leave for New York to attend Juilliard,"" he stated. Why, . . .? The young 25 year-old pianist said it's the only school where you can combine the classics and jazz to achieve the pop-type music, Roger Williams and Peter Merb plays. ""Why not the rock-group way,"" I asked Ricky. He staggered from the impact of the question. ""No way, would I go that way. I have been asked to travel with rock groups. You know the silver boots, up to your neck or gold rings on every finger. All due respects, but I'm into serious music and doing my own thing. I have no intention to bury myself in a rock group, even for the money.Berry, I have a love affair going with the piano."" When he started playing 'Evergreen' from the Barbara Streisand's movie 'A Star is Born', the meaning in his playing came out from the keys. I was thinking all the time, if he were playing on a baby-grand or Baldwin how different the tonal quality would be.DURING HIS 3 YEARS of study with John Handy, the young pianist decided to make a personal career of the piano.He is San Francisco State's Assistant to the Ballet and Modern Jazz Dance class. A job he said he really enjoys. All I can say is good luck to Ricardo, and if you have the time, or better yet take the time, to visit Ivey's and listen to this coming young pianist, ala Don Shirley before it's too late. Because, no way will Ivey's be able to keep a pianist of his caliber playing in the dining room. He's too good for the room. To bury a fine outstanding pianist there would be a loss. The future generation of youngsters needs to hear him in concert. You can hear, young Ricardo at Ivey's Tuesday's through Sunday evenings in Jack London Square. You can also get some good home cooked food at Ivey's and super homemade pies. The entire evening was made worthwhile by meeting young Ricardo, and I think we will have a grass roots on-going relationship for a long time to come.A LITTLE LIGHT HUMOR...Last week in the park, a family was playing with the 3-year-old on the slides. The father was ready to catch his daughter at the bottom. As she climbed the ladder, the ducks all around somehow were watching from the lake it seemed.

"712","Kamoi, David",1977-04-27,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Changes and proposals for further changes in future state bar examinations have been announced by the California State Bar.The changes came after lengthy pressure from minority bar exam candidates, who point out among other things that the bar exam discriminates against minorities by emphasizing corporate law instead of consumer law which minorities ordinarily deal with in practice.Starting with the results of this year's February bar exam, the state bar's committee of examiners will chose two answers ""considered to be good"" for every question, from the candidates' papers, and publish them for those studying for future bar examination. They will be made available at reasonable cost.A second change eliminates the conflict of laws section of the bar examination. Further, the committee is considering revisions of the scope of coverage of areas of law examination dealing with contracts, corporations, wills, community property and trusts. ""with a view toward further emphasizing subject malter related to general legal practice.""The third change allows an experiment whereby a candidate can now take one (of the two halves of the examination) at one sitting and sit for the other half within 21 months.Up to now, a candidate had to pass both essay and multiple choice halves of the exam in one sitting, and if he failed either, he would have to repeat the entire examination.The examination's multiple choice bar exam, second half, has six sections, while the essay part has 12. The subject matter in the multiple choice part is sometimes repeated in the essay part, meaning that the new advantage is that if a candidate passes the 12 sections of the essay part he has an easier time studying for the six areas of the multiple choice questions for the next exam in 21 months.David E. Nelson bar examination committee chairman, said the committee, however, reserves the right to cancel he experiment.Potential lawyers will still have to pass the Professional Responsibility Examination as the usual separate part of the par finals.Bill Taylor of the Third World Coalition, a group of minority lawyers, law students and teachers, was cautious about the meaning of the changes.""These changes do not still approach what we have asked for. There will still be the problem of the large number of third world people who do not pass the bar exam as contrasted with white exam takers.""On the subject of providing model answers for potential candidates to study. Taylor said this was welcome, and he thanked the state bar for keeping their promise to provide such answers six months ago.However, on the second change, moving away from emphasis on corporate law and toward emphasizing general legal practice, he said. ""It is closer to what we want, but still not close enough. Won't find out what it means until we see the questions in the next bar examination.""He noted that the statement did not specifically call for de-emphasizing corporate law; and neither did it adopt a move to emphasize consumer law.Kenneth McCloskey bar exam committee administrator, agreed that there was no commitment to de-emphasize corporate law subjects and emphasize consumer law subject matter in the examination.""What we are considering."" he said. ""is whether we should emphasize less such corporate law areas as complicated securities in favor of small business law. We are continuing to do research.""Taylor said the examination-taking options provided by the bar exam committee ""fall short"" of what the Coalition had asked for.He noted that candidates will have to practically study for the entire examination any time they go to sit for it. even though technically they are free to sit for one half at a time.The two halves, essay and multiple choice, contain the same subject matter. Taylor said, so the move amounts to studying for the whole examination twice, even though the student sits for a half at a time.What the Coalition had asked for, he said, was for candidates who fail only one or two of the total 12 sections in the two halves to be allowed to sit a second time only for those sections which they failed. The bar exam committee has not allowed that.Taylor said the problem at present is that the examination is so big that people have to stop doing everything for months prior to sit, and concentrate on studying for it. Richer and usually white students can afford to do that, but most minority candidates do not have the financial resources to leave their jobs and study for the examination. Hence more whites pass than non-whites, proportionately.He said the only way to correct this is to allow people to pass the exam in sections. so that poorer candidates can afford the time to concentrate on what they can viably do at one time.","1977",0,1

"723","Berkley, Tom",1978-07-19,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VS. ALLAN BAKKEAt long last the Bakke decision has been handed down by the Supreme Court of the United States The nine justices were as divided on the issue as was the public generally. The decision basically was a decision for everybody. Bakke was able to go on to the University of California at Davis Medical School by the Court saying that the selection process of the U.C. medical School at Davis was in violation of the 14th Amendment and has to be struck down. The court also concluded that it was not necessary for Bakke to prove that he would have been selected if the double-track system of the University selection process was not in vogue.In the same decision the Court held that race could be considered a factor in affirmative action programs. This was indeed a plus for minorities. The Court further suggested, and set as an example, the Harvard Plan of selecting persons to attend professional schools. This plan has resulted in a substantial increase of minority students at that University and is a plan that is not very hard to duplicate.All in all the decision left the Affirmative Action program of the Federal Government where it was before the Bakke decision and on balance minorities could have a much worse decision.What comes out of this important legal decision is the fact that the law is an ever-changing science. Interpretations of any given statute vary with the economic, social and political climate of the country at the time the question is at issue. The constitution is not a static vehicle, one built in cement. The Justices who hear the cases are human beings and are subject to human influences.The Constitution which for two hundred years has been used to keep the Negro from becoming a full-fledged citizen, is now being interpreted in a way to make him a citizen, although the basic rudiments of the Constitution are not changed in its written form. This is a concept with which it is not easy for the layman to deal, and most lawyers never understand it until they are almost on the eve of retirement. In reading the statutes, however, the Court is quick to point out that things have changed, interpretations have changed, and attitudes have changed in so far as the Judges are concerned. The Bakke case is a clear example of this change.Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first and only Black Associate Justice on the Supreme Court bench, wrote an historical opinion which, I believe, goes to the heart of the matter. I have reprinted that decision in full in this issue of our paper and recommend it for reading.At last, this should be said, the pretty words that are used by lawyers and judges to interpret the rights of citizens and particularly insofar as they deal with the civil rights of this country, are uniquely concerned with the Negro. The Black or the Negro, depending upon your preference, was the only person who came to the United States against his will and was kept in bondage for two hundred and fifty years. He was the only person to have the whole impact of the law used to make him worse than an indentured servant.It in to correct this evil that the Courts have struggled with their interpretation of the Constitution. It should be said here and now that any comparisons or analogies to what other persons who came voluntarily to the United States had to go through as they fought in their upward mobility does not in fact apply to the position that the Negro has been forced to endure in this country-all fancy legal expressions to the contrary notwithstanding. I balieve that Thurgood Marshall makes this point crystal clear.","1978",0,1

"736","",1978-08-03,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Part 2Editor's Note: The following is the text of a speech by Nigeria's commissioner for external affairs, Brigadier J.N. Garba, to the annual convention of the National Newspaper Publishers Convention last month in Cleveland, Ohio.Mr. President, the relations between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Nigeria have taken a new turn since the advent of the Carter Administration. This remarkable warmth in our relationship has been based on the changing attitude of the U.S. government to Africa and African problems. It seems to us that the aspirations of the African peoples for freedom and genuine independence are now shared by the American government and people. We are pleased to note that a country that fought a revolutionary war for independence is no longer prepared to give a blanket condemnation of African wars for independence.We are please that, in spite of America's recent preoccupation with Russian and Cuban activities in Africa, the America people have not been blinded to the fervent desire of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia to achieve independence and Black majority rule. But it is essential that the people of the United States, and particularly the mews media, should understand that the peoples of Africa have been forced to resort to the armed struggle in order to liberate Zimbabwe and Namibia from the white racist minority regimes.Understandably, the socialist countries of Eastern Europe have been, apart from African countries themselves, the main source of assistance to African freedom fighters. This does not mean, as the Western media try to make you believe, that all African nationalists who have taken up arms to fight for their freedom are necessarily Communists. If a few of them have ostensibly embraced Marxist ideology, they were forced into it by the attitude of the Western countries, which closed their eyes and ears to our cry for freedom. The West continues to give massive military assistance to our oppressors.You will, of course, recall that, when Europe, and indeed the Western world, was faced with the specter of Nazi domination, the West had no qualms about forming an alliance with the Soviet Union in order to liquidate the extreme racism that was the basis of Nazi philosophy. Equally, we in Africa have no regrets about receiving assistance from the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe in fighting the last vestiges of colonialism and racism in southern Africa.It is perhaps pertinent for me to emphasize here that Nigeria deserves encouragement and better understanding in the United States than has so far been the case. Those of you who are familiar with events in Nigeria know that the Nigerian government has been working in the past three years to lay a solid foundation for the return of a democratically elected civilian government in 1979. Indeed, there is no military government anywhere in the developing world that has worked as hard as we are doing to lay the foundation for a subsequent democratic parliamentary government.Any of you who is interested can check through independent sources that we have kept strictly to the spirit and the letter of the political program that we set for ourselves in 1975. Today a democratically elected Constituent Assembly has just concluded work on a new Executive Presidential Constitution, somewhat similar to the Constitution of the United States.It is expected that in the next few months Nigerians will once more begin to form political parties, and by the end of 1979 elections to a federal Parliament as well as to state Assemblies will have been completed on the basis of one-man, one-vote. Toward this end, the federal Electoral Commission has just concluded the registration of more than 47.7 million eligible voters in my country.In 1975 we launched a five-year National Development Plan, which envisaged a total expenditure of over $45 billion. In 1960 we had only one university for the whole country; today there are 13 universities and several colleges of science and technology. More than seven million children have now started school for the first time in a universal primary education exercise covering the whole country. To us progress and development do not mean simple statistics of percapita income. Progress is made when a village that previously had no school, no electricity, no pipe-borne water, and no medical facilities now has all these facilities.I say all this because there has been a tendency even in this country to ignore the democratic institutions and indeed the democratic traditions of the Nigerian people. Last May 23 the so-called minister of Information of South Africa, C.P. Mulder, wrote a tendentious article in the New York TIMES extolling the virtues of racism in South Africa and condemning the U.S. government for listening to what he called the military dictatorship of Nigeria.Without any fear of contradiction whatsoever, I wish to say that there is no basis for comparison between Nigeria now and the racist South African regime. Amnesty International can testify that there is not one political prisoner in Nigeria, because our judicial system, based on the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, is the most independent judiciary in all of Africa. In Nigeria we have no Preventive Detention Act, as there is in South Africa, whereby people can be detained for up to five years without trial. Indeed, the operation of the legal principle of habeas corpus in Nigeria is strictly adhered to.Also, there are no obnoxious pass laws in Nigeria. In South Africa pass laws are used to control every movement of the 20 million Black people of that unfortunate country. Too often these serious violations of human rights in South Africa have been overlooked by the Western news media, which prefer to cite the isolated examples of one or two African countries that have undoubtedly violated the human rights of their citizens. We Nigerians have never been indifferent to any violation of human rights by any African leader. It is only that we do not wish to wash our dirty linen in public. So we have channeled our displeasure at such violations through quiet diplomacy.It is, however, very important that a clear distinction should be made between the brutalization of fundamental human rights in South Africa and violations in one or two Black African countries. In South Africa there are two systems of laws--one system for the white man and one for the Black man--such that justice is meted out to people purely on the basis of the color of their skin. More importantly, the South African system is a system of institutionalized racism that they euphemistically refer to as separate development, or plural development. Racism is always the same thing, no matter what you call it.But Nigeria is a different country, and we are glad to say that we intend to remain different in the sense that, as General Obasanjo has said, the government of Nigeria is dedicated to the objective of building in Nigeria an African society that is disciplined, just, fair, and humane.Mr. President, I cannot end these remarks without returning to what I consider the central theme of this statement, and that is, the necessity for the people of Africa to forge strong links with the people of African descent here in the United States of America. We believe that Black Americans can do a lot in influencing, not only the African policies of the U.S. government, but also the attitudes of the people of the United States toward Africans. Black legislators, businessmen, writers, publishers, artists, and other Black people from all walks of life in this country can do a lot to ensure that the image of their mother continent is properly and correctly reflected here in the United States. We Nigerians are prepared to work together with our Black brothers in America to ensure that the African image is so properly presented.Perhaps we could begin by arranging a program of exchange visits between our two peoples. Many of you will certainly gain a wealth of additional experience by traveling to Nigeria to see what we are trying to do there. Our journalists, publishers, writers, and artists will also be greatly enriched by a properly organized visit to the United States to learn from their Black brothers and sisters here in this country. The Atlantic Ocean should not be seen as an obstacle to forging closer relations between our two peoples. Indeed it should be seen as a body of water that nourishes the centuries-old ties between us.As I said earlier, Africa is a continent of diversity and a continent that is abundantly blessed with vast quantities of natural resources. In the struggle for freedom and economic independence we need the sympathy, the understanding, and the assistance of our Black brothers in the United States. The idea of African freedom is an idea whose time has come.The idea of respect for the dignity and the fundamental human rights of the Black man is an idea whose time has come. Africa has come of age, and it is time for the world, East or West, to recognize that the destiny of Africa is in the hands of Africans and Africans alone.","1978",0,1
"737","",1978-12-21,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Jack Tatum doesn't know what he is going to do for Christmas. He hasn't had to plan any celebrations at this time of year for the last six years, because the free safety for the Oakland Raiders has been preparing for the playoffs.So have most of the other Raider veterans. Oakland's second non-playoff year in the last 12 seems almost unrealistic--the third tragedy in the last month.Even as he prepares for this premature vacation, Tatum has given some thought to the Raiders' next season.""There were some good things this year, and there were some bad,"" he said. ""We are going to work everything out, and we'll be back next year.""The good things were that the Raiders won nine games. The bad, well, they lost seven.Head coach John Madden summed it up succinctly after the Raiders manhandled playoff-bound Minnesota last weekend. He said, ""If we had won ten games, we would be in the playoffs.""A near miss when the Raiders encountered countless strange occurrences, such as missed extra points, missed field goals, fumbles, and dropped passes, should not be disheartening to the Silver and Black. Destiny appeared to be against them from the opening contest in Denver.A muffed point just before the first half ended gave the Denver defense a 7-0 lead to work with instead of finding both teams entering their lockerrooms tied 0-0.Each week there was something new causing the team and the staff anxiety. In other seasons Oakland would have a laugher or two so the team could relax. But not this year. They were all tough for the Silver and Black.The laugher seemed to materialize in the first quarter of the finale against Minnesota when the Snake (Ken Stabler) and company jumped off to a 21-0 first-quarter lead. At the conclusion Oakland was holding on to a 27-20 lead as the Vikings fought for overtime.Some folks have already sounded the death knell for Oakland. Those are the ones who were openly or secretly hoping the Raiders would fall upon bleak times.""We are a proud team,"" said running back Clarence Davis, who sat out the season on the injured reserve list. ""We are going to keep our heads up, no matter what things are said about us.""A lot of teams have come off a good year and had a bad year,"" Davis continued. ""I just hope this was one of those bad years for us and we come back next year.""Davis's services were sorely needed, for one thing. He has seldom gotten the praise he deserves, but he is considered the best blocking back on the team. An indication of that was Mark van Eeghen getting his 1,000 yards rushing in the last game of the season. With Davis leading the way, he had two consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in 14 games.Most people want to be home for Christmas, but for the Oakland Raiders that's money out of their pockets, and they don't like it. They would prefer to get back into their normal routine--Christmas and New Year's in some cold, freezing place like Denver, Pittsburgh, or Baltimore. Maybe they should speak to Santa Claus about next Christmas.Photo (Raiders' offense line protects the Snake.)","1978",0,0

In Europe some 40 percent of all the cars sold today are front-wheel drive.The weight and space saved in a front-wheel drive car by eliminating the drive shaft and having the complete transmission and differential up front allows for roomier interiors with flat floors and a lighter body for greater fuel economy.One of the most successful new front-wheel drive cars is the sporty-looking Le Car by Renault, the fourth largest auto maker in the world. The French import is a do-everything, inexpensive-to-buy and economically-to-operate, stylish family vehicle.The car is so economical that the 1978 model's combined EPA highway and city gas mileage of 31 MPG already exceeds the federal government's regulation requiring a minimum 27.5 combined gas mileage by 1985.Le Car's standard features include rack-and-pinion steering, independent suspension and steel-belted radial tires. Its long wheelbase and torsion bar suspension gives Le Car a luxury car ride, and its roomy interior gives it luxury-car spaciousness.Drivers will find that front-wheel drive cars have better traction. With the weight of the engine up front, and with the wheels pulling through snow or over wet pavement, such cars are less likely to slip and slide.The car's handling is rated among the best in its class by Consumer Guide magazine.

The compromise calls for lowering the nation's unemployment to four percent of the workforce, three percent for adults, by 1983. But it establishes no new government programs to meet that goal and no methods to enforce it or to hold anybody accountable if the goal is not met. The weakened version of the bill also fails to identify unemployment as the nation's most pressing problem, as the original legislation, co-authored by the late Senator Hubert Humphrey and southern California Congressman Augustus Hawkins, did.

""During his visit,"" the letter says, ""Ian Smith has made numerous claims for the internal settlement. We believe most Americans would agree that the internal settlement is inadequate and unfair if they knew the facts.""

Duker and D. Jacque Grinnell say Black economic penetration and full integration into the American economic system are necessary for reaping the full benefits of American society.""Progress in the economic sphere, all things considered, can be the necessary precursor of progress and equality in other spheres,"" the authors wrote.The article was published recently in The Review of Black Political Economy.Duker and Grinnell point out that economic progress is not to be measured by higher incomes, but rather by becoming more and more a part of the ""warp and woof"" of the economic system as a decision maker, planner, or controller.Enter accounting, for, by its very nature, accounting is involved in all three of these functions. The profession, according to the authors, is growing rapidly and is experiencing a shortage of manpower. This growing need for more trained accountants is expected to continue, reflecting basic changes in the national economy, which calls for more detailed accounts of how resources are expended.The authors wrote: ""In the white sector...there has been a general withdrawal from the sentiment that supported (ofttimes reluctantly) aspects of affirmative action. No references or citations are needed to demonstrate this. The mood, if not pervasive, is sufficiently widespread to be recognizable.""Because of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, establishing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the need for Black accountants is even more pronounced.","1978",1,0

They also have a shuffleboard where Howard beat me two games to none for the beer and sandwiches.The great thing about the little restaurant is that it has been there for years, and years. The owner can tell you baseball buffs all you want to know about the old seals, and all the old time players of the past. You can find all the OPD(Oakland Police Department) fellows, Ballplayers, you name them eating that great Clam Chowder or those great sandwiches salami, tuna fish or club house to name a few.

AIM reasoned if City Center was built out to a full service regional shopping center, it would take business away from Hilltop Mall in Richmond. Southland in Hayward and Sun Valley in Concord, all . . . operated centers.In the second article Grubb and . . . defense of both their poposal and the integrity of the Taubman Company were reported. However no starting date for construction or timetable for completion of the center was forthcoming from G&E.The question now is what are Oakland's options vis a vis the develoment of the shopping center.Responsibility for the present hiatus in City Center activity can not be piaced with the administration of the city's first Black Mayor Lionel J. Wilson. Rather Wilson, who has been in office less than a year, inherited the City Center situation from the Reading years.Wilson and the council are currently faced with the task of filling several key positions at City Hall. Oakland is currently, without a City Manager, since Cecil Riley's resignation in February.And, possibly moreimportantly the vision and leadership of John A. Williams, whoheaded the Redevelopment Agency until his death in 1976 has not been duplicated or replaced. David Hoard, the head of the Office of Cumminity Development after Williams, resigned in March, will serve until a replacement is found for him.There appears to be three paths which the city can take to get new blood flowing into the shopping center project.In the interest of fairness, Grubb and Ellis should be given a chance to explain how and when it will begin construction. With completion of the Grove-Shafter Freeway due to begin in January 1979. Grubb and Ellis should be able to give the city a timetable for completion of the center.Grubb and Ellis has experienced financial difficulties since they entored into the contract with the city. Since G& E is not in a position to fianance the development and the Taubman interest is in question perhaps G&E could negotiate for a different partner. This could be done . . . approval of the city under the . . . contract.A second option would be for the city to erminate the contract with Grubb and Ellis, and put the remaining development out for new bids.Under the terms of their contract with Grubb and Ellis the city could eriminate the contract if the following on ations were met.The city requested development and Grubb and Ellis did not comply.The City gave notice of default after a reasonable period of time.The city proved default by G&E.If the city decided to terminate its agreement with Grubb and Ellis a novel option it could take would be to contract with the Port of Oakland to complete the shopping enter development.The Port is in a position to raise funds for its development and might be able to do the same for the city. The Port has the expertise to develop the center. Three of the Port Commissioners. Post Publisher Tom Berkeley, Ted Connolly and President Chet Soda have extensive experience in development. Connolly currently manages 8 shopping centers in California which he has developed. The Port staff also is well grounded in development skills. The dame expertise which has been used to build the Port of Oakland into the second largest container port in the U.S. and the largest port on the West Coast could be utilized to make Oakland's City Center a model regional shopping center.Whatever path is to be taken, it seems only fair that the citizens of Oakland be given some idea of what is going to happen and when they can work and shop at City Center.Photo (HARD AT WORK for a good cause, this ""paint in"" was part of the face lift given to the Oakland Knowland, Park Baby Zop this week.

When the festival was started three years ago, it was set up for two reasons, according to Walter Turner, coordinator of the event. ""Well, we started out with three people helping the first year; this time we had eight. The first reason we started was so we could have an exchange of information with communities because we are so far away. The second reason was because of the opportunity for craftsmen to exhibit their products and meet with other people.""This year the organizations were raising money so programs and children centers could stay open.Marin City is more than 94 percent Black. Turner says that Black people started arriving in 1942 to work in local ship-yards, but Marin City is still unincorporated. Because it has a small tax base, there are problems with community centers, libraries, and many other things.But the people did turn out to attend the festival, which was dedicated to George Graham, the executive director (equivalent to the mayor) who was killed some months back. It was an all-day affair, with art work, leather goods, jewelry, nearly every kind of food you'd want, and all to the good sounds of Stanley Jackson and Joy, Jimmy McCracklin Blues Band, the Charles Moffitt Family, Bobby Hutcherson and Friends, and the Wajumbe African Dance Troupe.Sharon Turner, who also helped in the planning, said, ""This is the best lineup of music we've ever had. We used to have problems, but they want to play here now.""It's not surprising, either. The crowd was upwards of 2,000 throughout the day.One of the highlights of the day was the raffle. The first prize was $100, but there were still 19 other prizes, which included a case of champagne, record albums, dinner for two at Connie's in San Francisco, and two sandwiches from Louie's Delicatessen in Sausalito.The festival was a success, and this predominantly Black and Black-run town is making a name for itself. As Susie Edwards, who is with the Marin City Project Area committee, said. ""Herewe are in the midst of the richest county in the nation, and things are taking place here.""Photo (Thousands attended the festival dedicated to George Graham.)","1978",0,1
"750","",1978-06-14,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Question: I try to be a good Christian in my daily life but I see so much rudeness and disrespect everywhere I go that it's really getting to me. How should I react to this kind of thing without letting people walk all over me?Answer: Your question reminds me of an incident related by a young mother. Her day began with spilled milk and tears, the tire was flat, and the children were late for school. The baby was sick, and the nurse in the doctor's office was rude; the clerk was too busy talking and laughing to carry out the groceries, and the drycleaning wasn't finished.By the time she got home that afternoon, she was so upset that only some quiet time with God could change ber mood. As she relaxed and asked God to quiet her jangled nerves, she seemed to see bright and sparkling jewels. What did they mean? Deep inside her God said, ""These are my precious jewels which I have placed before you to care for. They represent my children...the ones who have been so rude and unkind to you today."" Then she remembered Malachi 3.17. ""They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels.""Your question is how to react to people, but I don't think we should react to people. I think we should act unto God. Why allow the behavior of others to tell us how we should behave? Animals react to stimuli, but human beings can act unto God, we can choose to obey God. And He has told us to treat others the way we want to be treated. It's easy to be kind to those who are nice to us, but it's not so easy to be pleasant to disagreeable, rude, and hateful people. It takes the love of Jesus in us to regard others from God's viewpoint as His jewels. If Jesus had reacted to the insults and blows of the people around Him, we would hot have received the blessings God wanted to give us. Hut Jesus didn't react to people. He obeyed God. He has blessed us, and now we are to bless others. And not just those we love out those God loves, all His children. Let me give you a simple way to do this. In your spirit say to everyone you meet during the day, ""God bless you.""You don't have to be concerned about people walking over you. Leave that to God--He is completely able to defend those who live the life of love that Jesus calls us to.","1978",0,0

Since last June she has been a pilot for a commuter airline in North Carolina.""For a long time my goal has been to be one of the first formale captains for a major commercial airline."" Miss Brown said.She learned to fly at age 17 as part of a family project.""Mommte and Daddy came home one day and announced we were all taking flying lessons,"" she said, ""They believed there had to be a better, faster way to get from point A to point B than by car, so the three of us learned to fly.""Miss Brown, a native of Baltimore, Md., grew up in Anne Arundel County. She received her bachelor of science in home economics and education from the University of Maryland, College Park. Her parents, Elaine and Gilbert Brown reside in a suburb of Baltimore, where her mother is an art resource teacher in the Baltimore City Schools and her father is a general contractor and custom builder. Throughout college and as a home-economics teacher she continued to fly and in 1975 started on her instrument rating and commercial license. In April of that year an article in Ebony magazine caught her attention and ultimately cost the country one teacher and gave it another airline pilot.The article was about Wheeler Airlines in Raleigh, N.C., the first scheduled Black owned and operated Airline in the nation.""In the article offered me encouragement. I contacted Mr. Wheeler and said I had read the story and wanted an interview over Easter vacation.

Wheeler, then a co-pilot and now a captain for Piedmont Airlines in addition to owning his own commuter line, picked up Miss Brown and her mother at Norfolk, Va. Municipal Airport, where they had flown in their family plane.""He (Wheeler) had to do three touch-and-go landings in the 737 and Mommie and I went along,"" she said. ""Then we went sailing on Chesapeake Bay and my interview was held on Mr. Wheeler's sailboat. We talked all day.""Just before we left, Mr. Wheeler asked 'Any thing else?' and I said 'Tell me if I have a job this summer.' He said yes.""Miss Brown got her multi engine rating and took the job at Wheeler Airlines as an occasional pilot without pay just to get the experience. When she wasn't flying that summer she worked as a reservationist and earned about $300.Then last August she became a resident pilot for Wheeler in Raleigh flying Beech 99 aircraft.As a pilot for a small commuter line, she had to do everything. She worked reservations, wrote passenger tickets, hooked up battery carts to the planes and even loaded baggage.""I swear that everyone was an encylopedia or brich salesman and I had to load the bags by myself,"" she said. ""It's surprising how strong I became.""Miss Brown said Wheeler always understood that her ultimate goal was to fly for a large commercial airline.

Kickoff time for the AFC Western Division clash is set for 1 p.m.The intra-state rivalry dates back to 1960, initial year of play in the American Football League. Although losing all six games played between the teams during the first three AFL seasons, the Raiders now lead the series 23-12, with two games having ended as ties.The Raiders and Chargers met earlier this season while Tommy Protho was still head coach at San Diego. Oakland rallied for a pair of fourth quarter touchdowns to win that one in the final seconds, 21-20.Both San Diego and Oakland come into this Sunday's game following Sunday losses on the road. The Chargers were downed by the Detroit Lions, 31-14, in the Pontiac Silverdome while the Raiders were defeated by the Seattle Seahawks 27-7 in the Kingdome.New Charger head coach Don Coryell, who took over after the fourth league game this year, used two quarterbacks against Detroit. Bay Area product Don Fouts started and hit on five passes for 118 yards and one touchdown while James Harris completed sight for 132 yards and one TD. On the season Fouts is now 119 for 192 for 62 percent completion, 1,436 yards and 10 touchdowns while Harris has hit on 19 of 36 for 53 percent, 243 yards and one score.The top running back-and pass receiver- for San Diego is Lydell Mitchell, acquired from Baltimore in a preseason trade. He leads San Diego rushers this year with 331 yards and tops the receiver list with 29 catches for 268 yards, including a 55 yard score against the Lions.Starting wide receivers are rookie sensation John Jefferson who has already caught five touchdown passes and wily 10-year veteran Charlie Joiner who has caught 23 passes this year and is averaging over 18 yards per catch. Bob Klein and Pat Curran give solid performances at tight end as blockers and receivers.The Chargers defense is built around an outstanding defensive line. San Diego has sacked opposing quarterbacks 27 times for 229 yards, tops in the AFC. The sack leader is right defensive end Fred Dean who has already dumped passers for almost 100 yards in losses. Dean teams up with tackle Gary Johnson on the right side while tackle Louis Kelcher (6-5, 282) and end Leroy Jones (6-8, 265) create a mammoth roadblock on the other side.The Raider 3-4 defense will be sorely tested by the Chargers who gained 372 yards against Oakland in the earlier 1978 match.

So naturally I was taken aback by her letter's abrupt, accusatory first sentence demanding to know where I was the day her favorite bill came up for a vote.At first I was angry; then later my anger turned to quiet fuming; then much later, with rationality replacing my initial reaction - I decided to personally respond to her indignant inquiry.I must admit I enjoyed the experience. After all a Congressman these days doesn't often get a chance to explain his actions, without being interrupted, or being ceremoniously insulted.My initial point was that a Congress man's dual functions of being a legislator, and a representative of his constituents sometimes gets criss-crossed.An important debate is taking place in the Congress. An equally important series of district matters, demanding the Congressman's attention, promises to blow up, if he doesn't return to his district immediately.What should the Representative do?If he doesn't attend the debate, he may miss a vote, and on top of it all get bawled out by the newspapers and his constituents for ""friviously"" ignoring a major issue.If he fails to meet with his constituents in his district, he will be accused of thinking he's a big shot, of being a victim of ""Potomac fever,"" or of being less interested in district matters, and more interested in Washington glamour.He will also be reminded that it's the people back home who sent him to Washington in the first place, therefore his duty to them takes precedence over everything else.It's obviously not a simple matter of ""where were you on such and such a day,"" for example.But to answer the lady's question - I had to inform her that that period of extreme interest to her, when she thought I should have been in Washington and not out ""fishing,"" so happened to be a time when I was in my district. In fact I was in my district for six days at that one point.It also happens that my vote on the issue was noted in the House, since I was paired with a member whose vote was opposite to mine. So my position on the matter was public, although I did not technically get credited with a vote.I also indicated to the lady (who by the way does live in my district) that I had voted four times previously on the same bill. It was therefore not a matter of voting ""affirmatively"" by being absent, as she put it, in order to avoid my taking a stand.Now I'm not sure she will appreciate my candor in responding to her concerns in the way I did. But I do know that as a Congressman I am responsible to my constituents for my actions, and I therefore try not to shilly-shally on an issue, when questioned about my position. I know that the lady's views on the issue (abortion) are in disagreement with mine. I am interested in her views however, because the views of my constituents help me decide how to best cast my vote on such matters.After I have weighed all the various sides of an issue, my vote must reflect not only constituent views, but my vote must also reflect my conscience as well.I am glad that the lady wrote to me. Such confrontation may not always be pleasant, but they are necessary.I'm not sure the picture is any clearer, however. But since I'm two persons wrapped up in one, the difficult choice of staying in Washington for a vote - or repairing to the district to put out a fire - will continue to be difficult.If there is an easier choice, I'd like to know about it.","1978",1,0
"761","Spigner, Nieda",1978-04-26,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","It's not easy to get a book published, even if it's an excellent piece of work. It's fairly difficult for white authors to get a 'break' into the publishing industry, but it's even more difficult for Black authors. While the majority of white authors are able to devote most of their time to writing, exploring and creating new ideas, the majority of Black authors are working two jobs and 'moon-light' writing.Once you manage to complete a collection of poems, or even a novel, the next step is finding someone who will publish your work. Publishing and marketing are the toughest areas of the literary field for Black authors.If you are lucky enough to get a 'break' (which usually means you know some of the 'right' people) in the publishing industry, one of the larger publishing houses like McGraw Hill or Random House may buy your work. Most Black authors aren't that lucky.You could solicit your manuscript amongst different publishers by mail, hoping that in all of his stacks of literature he might happen to come across your work and take the time to read it. That process is risky because most of the manuscripts sent to the various publishers are never read. The ideal situation is to have an agent to market your work for you. Agents cost money, but they are supposed to be experts at getting publishers to look at manuscripts that might otherwise go overlooked. Agents aren't easy to find. They generally find the author, after he's displayed signs of promise in the literary field.Two Black women poets in the Bay Area have decided to answer their publishing problems by trying a growing trend among many authors: independent publishing. Jacqueline Cherry of East Palo Alto had her work published by Zikawuna Communications, a small independent publisher in Palo Alto, and Ethel Mae Layne of Oakland published her own poems under her own company, Ghetto Ghirl Publishing.""I'm not concerned that a large publisher will pick up on my work,"" said Jacqueline Cherry in a soft-spoken voice. ""I'm just not geared towards having someone big consider me big.""Cherry didn't get a break, but she did manage to get her work published. Recently her collection of poems were voted into the Ravenawood curriculum where students kindergarten through sixth grade will be exposed to her work. ""Just A Black Rose"" is her first book of poems ever published.Ethel Mae Layne published her own poems in a collection called ""Centennial Sentiment."" She decided to publish her own books because as she says. ""Black people have to do for themselves and stop depending on the large publishers.""The majority of Layne's poems were written during the height of the civil rights movement in the sixties. Her poems are bitter-sweet with love, anguish, hope and frustrations of a Black woman who identifies as a ""Negro before the term was eclipsed by Black power,"" says Layne.Both Layne and Cherry speak through the Black experience. Neither of the women are interested in being in the public scene. Layne prefers not to have her picture in the newspaper, and Cherry says, ""I don't mind being an author that isn't seen on television making speeches. I'm a writer who would rather stay in the background.""One of the reasons why Cherry decided to avoid the larger publishers is because she feels she is respected more as an individual by her smaller publisher. According to her explanation of the situation, ""It's much easier to work with a publisher who knows where you your're coming from.""Cherry hopes to complete another collection of poems. She is a poet. Layne is working on a novel that she will probably publish later. Both women are certain they will continue to work independently. And, both women are single parents; Cherry has two children and Layne has three children. Cherry is younger than Layne, but both have to work another job to supplement their writing incomes. Both are strongly guided by their spiritual beliefs: Cherry practices meditation, and Layne practices prayer.Both women are sensitive writers, and it shows in their work. Both are strong believers in 'positive' approaches to life, and their works (even though the subject differ) carry messages that are inspirational to all people.Now that both women are published authors, they are learning the business end of the literary field. Cherry is assisted by her publisher at Zikawuna Communications, and her recent entrance into the school curriculum will probably help widen her exposure. ""Just A Black Rose"" isn't easily available on the open market, but they can be ordered from Zikawuna Communications Company, P.O. Box 703, Palo Alto, Ca., 94302.""Contennial Sentiment"" is also unattainable of the open market. Layne handles most of her own distribution through churches, clubs and other organizations.

They are angry because the VA has denied New College the approval necessary in order to receive educational benefits to which veterans are entitled.At a press conference today at the law school, the veterans said that they will be forced to take more drastic action if the law school is not approved immediately by the VA. A group spokesman said the possibility of filing suit against the VA has not been ruled out. He also said that New College students might sit in at the VA Regional Office in San Francisco.As Michael Boyd, veteran and law student put it, ""Unless the more than $50,000 in benefits which is already owed us is made available, some of us will have to drop out of school. I do not want to have to drop out of school because the bureaucrats at the VA don't want to see veterans become progressive public interest-minded attorneys.""According to Michael Blecker, Another veteran at New College, the law school should have been approved for educational benefits in August, 1977. Blecker said, ""the VA has not approved the school, citing such reasons as poor lighting and our use of the words 'credit hours' instead of 'classroom hours'. I joined the Army in 1967 right out of high school and at that time I was taught not to look at service in the military as a threat but as a chance to get out of Reading, Pa., save some money and learn a trade. It's hard not to be bitter.""Rocky McGill, also a veteran, said ""we have complied with all the requests of Max Cleland. VA Director, contacted legislators such as Senator Cranston who is not only California's Senior Senator but also Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veteran Affairs, and still we have not been approved for receipt of our benefits.""Some of the veterans are worried about another problem. Said Robert Heimbaugh, ""I will be excluded from receiving benefits after August of this summer. Ten years have expired since my discharge and by the recent act of Congress, I won't be eligible to use my remaining entitlement to GI benefits. More than that, unless New College is finally approved, I won't even be able to get a VA Education loan.

"773","Fleming, Thomas",1978-03-16,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Jimmy Carter has suggested one reform that many U.S. citizens will heartily agree is long overdue, that is, that civil service workers, whom many individuals necessarily encounter and who often behave like a most arrogant breed, should be reevaluated on the basis of their actual performances.There is a widespread feeling that the entire structure of civil service employees, whether municipal, county, state, or federal, should be revamped from top to bottom.The idea of protecting civil service workers' jobs at first was a very sound idea in granting security to persons who were brave enough to seek jobs in the lower echelons of public service.Advocates of this were rudely upset by some earlier Presidents, such as Andy Jackson, who upon being elected to office promptly fired all public servants who had secured their jobs as a form of political reward from the President who preceded Jackson. This was known by political scientists as the spoils system--a system that affected not only federal jobholders but likewise jobholders on the state and lower levels. Such workers attended to the day-to-day administration of government services.Carter looked at the monster created by civil service, and Carter is not alone in coming to such a conclusion about it. Carter, along with many other outraged citizens, decided that there are far too many incompetents hiding behind the safety of their tenure within the ranks of civil service employees.Never in past history have so many persons taken examinations that would lead to their being hired in specific fields, with the majority of those taking these examinations being persons with marked incompetencies for the kinds of work they intend to perform.Civil service provides a lifetime tenure until the age of retirement together with many other benefits, such as generous health plans, generous vacation plans, and a safety wall whereby civil service workers cannot be discharged without grave cause. The firing plan is designed so that the worker selected by his supervisor can be granted a hearing before being discharged; in many instances after the hearing the worker is simply transferred from one governmental agency to another one, and his or her pay is not affected one bit.In the eyes of the general public one of the worst offenders hiding sheer incompetency under the umbrella of job protection granted by the federal government is that curious collection of employees who loaf away their days in the Department of Health. Education, and Welfare, commonly known by persons who face this . . . every now and then, for whatever reason, as HEW.First, the employees who staff HEW offices directly dealing with persons who find it necessary to go to an HEW office assume an attitude that they are there in the office primarily to treat whoever enters the door for whatever reason as a foe.It would be a revealing experience for persons who do not seek any type of assistance from HEW to go by any given office and see just how the staff conducts its daily relations with the general public.A staff member of Congressman Philip Burton's informed this writer that the congressman's office receives more complaints about HEW than about any other federal agency office.This writer himself had a harrowing experience in sheer incompetence from HEW, which began when this writer reached the age when he was eligible to receive social security benefits. This writer did not retire from gainful employment and asked nothing from social security. There must be a division or section or branch in HEW that does nothing but research the birthdates of all persons who are registered in the system.Anyway, the writer received another card, which informed him that he was eligible for Medicare. He did not seek this part of the program, since the Sun Reporter, like all progressive employers, has a health care plan.The writer, since he was not drawing any other benefits, paid the insurance premiums monthly. The writer moved in August 1975 to a new address and notified HEW. The writer paid his premiums every quarter from August 1975 to December 1977. All persons who pay the premium are billed every quarter. The writer did not receive any further billings, because, when the writer discovered in the summer of 1977 that he was not eligible, he made inquiries of HEW. He was informed that he had moved. Yet he was billed every qua ter for 19 months. A long argument developed over the writer's paying the premiums for the period when he was not billed and also for the current period.The writer is determined not to pay for the period when he was not insured. In fact the readers will soon read of the writer being cast in a new role, that of a strong advocate of reform in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.I never refused to pay the premiums. They simply did not bill me, and I refuse to pay for that period. I am willing to pay my premiums, and I did pay one in January 1978.","1978",0,0

And even though some women are starting to bake their own bread--some are still holding back because they feel it's too time-consuming. But I have a recipe this month that proves you can bake homemade bread in a little over two hours--probably quicker than Mama made hers.This recipe was given to me by Pamela Crossley, a junior Betty Crocker of San Francisco. The bread is called Virginia Bacon and Onion Casserole Bread, and it's delicious. The only special item you need is either a loaf pan or a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish (Pam uses a loaf pan).1/2 lb. bacon, chopped1 large onion, chopped1 pkg. (13 3/4 oz.) hot roll mix3/4 cup lukewarm water2 eggs1 tablespoon poppy seedsIn a skillet, fry the bacon and onion until they're golden brown, stir occasionally until crisp. Let the mixture cool until it's lukewarm; do not drain the fatty drippings. Pour the yeast (which comes in the box of hot roll mix) into a bowl, and add the water. Stir in the eggs, the bacon/onion mixture, and the drippings. Stir in the remaining hot roll mix; then add the poppy seeds. Beat until the dough is well blended and can be pulled cleanly away from the spoon. Pour the batter into whatever greased dish you've decided to use, and let it rise in a warm place (the top of the stove is fine) for 45 to 60 minutes, until it doubles in bulk. Bake in a preheated moderate oven (375 degrees) for 30-35 minutes until the loaf sounds hollow when thumped. Unmold and cool thoroughly on a rack before cutting.I like this bread hot, spread with butter, and with a cup of hot tea with lemon. You can taste every ingredient, and it seems to melt in your mouth. But if you don't plan on eating all at one sitting, it can easily be frozen. Just be sure to thaw for two hours at room temperature before reheating.EXTRA TIP: If any of you readers are into gourmet food, or are just interested in an orgy of food, go see ""Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?""

The two cops were patrolling Webster Street when the concerned citizen halted them and informed them that three unidentified males were performing acts of aggression against another unidentified male, and the citizen said that he thought the lone male would appreciate any help that the two cops could physically provide.The citizen further said that the commotion was on Pixley Street, one of those short alleys that bisect the city here and there and that are often overlooked on maps meant for tourists.The two cops quickly turned into Pixley Street. What they saw confirmed the information that the concerned informant had furnished.A lone man was engaged in a struggle with three men who seemed bent on inflicting physical harm on him, but he was putting up very valiant resistance.Two attackers saw the cops turn into the alley and suddenly decided that they had more important matters to attend to in some other part of the city. The two alert attackers took off at a very fast footpace. They perhaps ought to think about trying out for the American sprint team in the next Olympic Games.The victim, who was later identified as Mark Meier, shouted. ""I'm being robbed"" Meier was still locked in combat when the cops exited from the patrol car.The remaining suspect, later identified as Andre Robert Benton, attempted to emulate his two partners, but Meier and Officer 1717 gave chase. Officer 1602, seeing the fleeing suspect reach inside his jacket, shouted to his partner to look out, warning that the suspect had a gun.Officer 1717 then drew his own service revolver and ordered the suspect to freeze. Benton immediately dropped a 38-caliber handgun, but then he broke out again at a fast footpace.Officer Number 1602 leaped into the patrol car and swiftly overtook the suspect. The policeman drove the car into such a position that the suspect was knocked to the ground. The suspect was at once handcuffed.Meier told the cops that he had been walking through Pixley Street drinking from a can of beer when the three approached him and one of them took the can of beer from him. Another one asked him for money. Meier refused to comply with this demand, and Benton drew a handgun and aimed it at Meier's head. The other two frisked him after pushing him up against the wall of a building.When the robbers found only $1 in the wallet, one of them drew a knife and held it to the victim's throat.At this time the police car was spotted by the third man, who acted as a lookout.Meier tried to block the two other robbers when they began to run. In this engagement Meier's thumb was cut.Benton, the not-so-fast member of the trio, was hauled off to City Jail and booked on suspicion of armed robbery and being an ex-felon carrying a concealed weapon.A 23-year-old resident of a house in the 1000 block of Divisadero Street went berserk following a long drinking bout in which he attacked his mother and another female in the house and broke out some windows in his mother's bedroom. Both women were attacked with a baseball bat, and the mother, in fear for her own safety, produced a .38-caliber handgun and fired one shot in the direction of her rampaging offspring.Police were called to the house and met an older brother of the suspect. He informed them that his brother became so annoyed about an unrevealed matter that he began to smash things in the office.The suspect picked up a bat and went for his mother and the other female in the house, allegedly striking the other woman on the arm with the bat.The mother of the suspect, alarmed at the proceedings and unable to calm her son with soothing words, produced the gun and fired one shot. The shot must have calmed him as far as his mother is concerned, for the police said nothing about his attacking his mother.When the police arrived, the suspect was still in an extraordinarily belligerent mood. He appeared to ignore the minions of law and order.The cops move sometimes very fast when they are present at a crime, and slapping a woman in front of cops means that they have to intervene without hesitation.The cops moved in on the suspect. This didn't diminish his belligerency until four cops wrestled him into a state of handcuffed and immobilized defiance.The suspect was booked on three counts of aggravated assault, which sometimes is a very calming influence on persons who have warlike tendencies.","1978",0,0

Before the end of hostilities, however, the Dons knew they had been in a donnybrook, if you will pardon the slight bit of humor.Fired up, Santa Clara jumped off to a 12-2 lead, with the enthusiastic home crowd cheering them onward. USF remained poised throughout, abreast of and passing the emotional Broncos. The Dons led at halftime, 39-34.The margin increased to only 7 points during the second half as the Broncos fought to find the correct formula to halt USF's offensive surge. They used four centers in order to nullify the offensive efforts of Don seven-foot center Bill Cartwright. In the process, they fouled him 14 times. They did, however, limit him to five field goals.It was left up to guard John (Chubby) Cox to carry the offensive load. Cox more than met the challenge, ending up with 25 points for the evening's activities.The war was only half over because the two clubs had a battle three days later at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. This time it was the enthusiastic fans of the Dons who would lend moral support to their team.Enthusiasm was certainly not lacking as the two teams squared off for the second battle of the week before another packed house.During the first portion of the initial period, the two teams struggled for control of the game. The infighting under the basket resembled a football game instead of a noncontact sport as the big men on both teams jostled one another for position.With the score 18-16 in favor of USF, the Dons threatened to break the game open as Rod Williams culminated a fast break with a driving layup. Then 6'9"" forward James Hardy stole a Bronco inbound pass and dunked over the Broncos' Kurt Rambis. He missed the ensuing free throw.The Broncos weren't broken yet. They fought back to take the lead, 32-31, on Mark Bruenig's short jumper from the top of the key.Cox followed with a jumper for USF. Then Bronco Londale Theus, who had 14 points in the first half, tied the score at 38-all with two minutes to go in the half. Cox broke the dealock with a jumper, and the Dons were never behind for the remainder of the contest.In the second half, as the Hilltoppers were traveling merrily, a strange set of circumstances led to a technical foul against the Dons. Then James Hardy, who had been almost dormant in the first contest, took charge.Personally he accounted or the Dons' next 6 points. Then Winford Boynes, who later fouled out with 22 points, hit quick hoops.The end was near as Don rooters began to shout, ""Blow them out.""Santa Clara had fallen into the trap that USF had laid for many of its opponents last year on the way to a 29-3 record. They had tried to run with the Dons. That can cause a team to self-destruct, and that's what happened to the Broncos on the way to a 90-70 thrashing.

Their performance revealed the influential showmanship of Sammy Davis Jr. Working together the past 13 years, the five men have complete knowledge of each other's style and range. Each performer is a star in his own right. However, the boys contribute their innate talent to the performance not as individuals but as a group. Their versatility entails the complete spectrum between soft ballads and funky rock and roll, especially in their ABC hit recordings, ""The Dramatic Jackpot,"" ""Drama"" and their latest release, ""Joy Ride.""The Dramatics forte is entertaining before a live audience. They radiate the wonderful feeling of happiness and their zany stage antics aimed at the audience is a show stopper. At the end of the show the boys got a well earned standing ovation by loyal fans. A few girls stepped on stage and danced a few minutes with members of the group.In a personal interview with the Dramatics backstage, I observed that they are a bunch of clean-cut young men. I asked Ron Banks who sings from bass to first tenor ""What makes the Dramatics click?"" He said, ""Vic, it is our vocal versatility, and extensive musical background We coordinate our know-how and it enables us to create our own songs and choregraphy. Through the years we worked hard; the first few years we worked for peanuts, one night stands at cheap night spots. We knew we had to make sacrifices to get where we are today, a success.""Ron impressed me very much, especially his last remark. ""Well Ron, to succeed, one must suffer. This is the American way of life. To be a successful self made man in any field is an achievement."" The boys told me that they were grateful that I made the effort to visit them after the show. In pertinent respect the Dramatics' superb clean showmanship adheres to the lofty traditions of the legitimate theater and the high standards this writer looks for when reviewing a show.

"780","Grossman, Aubrey",1978-11-02,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","For two years Representative Parren Mitchell and the entire Congressional Black Caucus have been working on what they call the ""Transfer Amendment."" What this means is to transfer funds from the inflated military budget to jobs programs, an improved and extended welfare program, aid to the cities, and similar programs.Taking into account the inflation now going on, the budget for 1979 cuts all these programs, including CETA. Yet the military budget, already containing tens of billions of dollars of waste, fat, and super profits, is increased 3 percent, after inflation is considered.This crazy system of priorities, which has its most devastating impact on Blacks and other minorities, has never been presented to the people for their approval. Now for the first time in our history the people have a chance to vote against the too-large military budget and the correspondingly too-small jobs and social programs. The question is on the ballot only in San Francisco; here it is called Proposition V.A yes vote is a vote to cut this $130-billion military budget. A Yes vote is a vote to provide jobs for minorities and especially minority youths, and to provide the badly needed funds for schools, welfare, child care, and similar programs.Proposition V has been endorsed by the whole labor movement--the Central Labor Council, Building Trades Council, and ILWU--with a big push from the Trade Union Committee for a Transfer Amendment, headed by Curtis McClain of ILWU.Proposition V unanimously endorsed by the Black Leadership Forum and by Black leaders Carlton Goodlett, Willie Brown, Percy Steele, Enola Maxwell, George Newkirk, the Rev. Cecil Williams, Supervisor Ella Hutch, Larry Martin, McClain, and others.Also endorsing V are Representatives Phillip and John Burton, Assemblymen Willie Brown and Art Agnos, Mayor George Moscone, Supervisors Harvey Milk, Gordon Lau, and Carol Ruth Silver, and Sheriff Eugene Brown.Besides providing absolutely necessary funds for jobs and other social programs, there are other important reasons for cutting the military budget. Money spent by the military produces far fewer jobs than money spent on any other kind of program. Government figures show that, if you cut, say, $10 billion from the military budget and spend it in any other way, you would produce roughly twice as many jobs as you lost.We have been hearing from President Carter that it is inflationary to increase wages, even to keep them in line with price rises, and health insurance cannot be enacted, because it would be too inflationary. However, the best-concealed secret of all time is the fact that the most inflationary factor of all is the swollen military budget. No matter what steps are taken to control inflation, prices will go up and up unless we slash the military budget.","1978",1,0

A film entitled ""The Great American Chocolate Factory"" will also be shown daily at noon.The exact origin of chocolate is not known. However, in 1519 Cortez found Montezuma drinking a bitter concoction called chocolatl. To make this drink more palatable for Europeans, the Spaniards added cane sugar. Soon this mixture found favor with the Spanish royal court, where its method of production remained a secret for nearly 100 years.Chocolate for eating wasn't invented until 1847. An English manufacturer combined chocolate liquor, extra cocoa butter, and sugar to produce solid chocolate. Soon this treat spread throughout Europe, each country adapting it to the national taste.Today an enormous variety of chocolate products are available, ranging from the popular Hershey bar to elegant Godiva bonbons.

An ordinance establishing a new city department, the Office of Economic Development and Employment, was passed unanimously by the Oakland City Council Tuesday night.The council, in companion ordinances, created two new commissions, the Economic Development Advisory Commission and the Employment and Training advisory Commission.The restructuring plan calls for two new departments under OEDE, the Economic Development, which will be brand new and the Employment and Training Department which will be the present Manpower Department.The hope is that the city's presently fragmented economic programs can be dealt with more effectively under one . . .The aim of the proposed new Economic Development Department would be to find ways of attracting new businesses and keeping old ones in Oakland.The Employment and Training Department (Manpower Department) would coordinate youth and adult training programs and public service employment and continue with CETA programing.

"786","Metcalfe, Rochelle",1978-02-23,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The saga of Leo ""Shorty"" Roberts continues.Like many. I had known Shorty for some time. I first became acquainted with him during the 1960s when I moonlighted as a cocktail waitress on Diviz. He was always on the Strip. One week last year I wrote a paragraph in this column about him. I'm glad I reflected upon him, for he bought up most of the papers there on Diviz. He was somewhat of a celebrity that week. The article hipped many to his real name, which even I did not know until I started writing ""I Heard That."" The way it turned out. I'm glad I took the time to say something nice about him.I remember one day while I chatted with him that he took from his pocket a worn wallet to show me a picture of three fine children whom he referred to as his sons and daughter. They were children to be proud of, I was surprised to know that he had a family, for I never thought of him as a family man.Saturday, Feb. 3, 1977, I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with his beautiful family. Many of you dudes on the street scene did not know that he had loved ones.Let me introduce you to them and tell you a little about each one: Thurza Roberts, Shorty's pleasant wife, who is a quiet-spoken woman and whom I immediately felt a friendship toward. She and Shorty had been married for 21 years--celebrating their 21st anniversary last Oct. 15. His daughter, 17-year-old Pam, who attends Washington High School, is a pretty young lady with coal-black silken hair. Pam wants to be a singer.Kevin, 15, greeted me as I entered the neat flat. The handsome young fellow wore tinted glasses and sported a full brown natural--looking very keen and exemplifying his father's features. The lad is a D.J. on Radio Station KPOO, spinning soul music every Saturday live from 4 until 7 p.m. He attends Roosevelt High. The youngest son, Leo Jr., age 12, looked a lot like his dad, but was taller and heftier. The two other children were short. Leo is mentally retarded, but he fits right into the family circle, as they treat him no different. He attends a special school in Los Gatos, called Ming Quong Children's Center, where he lives during the week, coming home on weekends.They were very sharp, well-mannered children. I made new friends that day in the Roberts household, and I left their home feeling very warm inside, knowing Shorty had such a personable family.In that circle at the Sportsman Inn, where we sat and rapped about Shorty, Ray Robinson remarked, ""Shorty supported his family better than any man I know."" Thurza told me that afternoon in their tidy living room that Shorty loved his children and was a good provider, for he always brought his money home.Shorty was a good hustler. Whenever you saw him on the streets he never had a dime--let him tell it. The fellows would buy him drinks, send him on errands to the cleaner's, etc., and he would pick up extra change that way.Kevin could not talk about his father, for he became choked up and tears welled in his young eyes; it was evident that it still hurt him to think about his dad. He told me that on the night his father passed at Mt. Zion he had tried to see him earlier in the evening but that the hospital staff would not let him visit his father's room (he was accompanied by another youth).Shorty died suddenly, shocking the family (and friends), for they did not know he was as seriously ill as it turned out to be...God did not let him suffer long.Last November he journeyed to Texas to bury his own father, who had died that month. Shorty had not seen his father since he left home as a 15-year-old. Since retiring as a seaman, he had not ventured from the Bay Area in years. Shorty stayed in Texas for approximately three days, returning to San Francisco late the third night (Nov. 18). After only an hour's sleep he arose as usual at 3:30 a.m. to make his gig at the airport. Thruza told me that he was not feeling so well when he returned from lexas, and that morning he was suffering with chills and fever, but he still continued to report to work for two days. Robinson noted he seemed sullen, but thought it was due to his father's death.Well, that Sunday, Nov. 20, he took off from work, returning the following day, Monday, Nov. 21. He fell ill that morning at his job and was rushed to Mt. Zion Hospital in S.F. It was diagnosed that he was suffering from pneumonia. While he was in the hospital, he suffered a heart attack. Thurza said it took two respirators to try to revive him, but to no avail. Shorty had been hospitalized for about ten hours when he met his untimely demise at 11:04 p.m., that evening. His wife told me that she had talked to him over the telephone earlier that evening and that he seemed fine. She was unable to go to his bedside that evening because of the torrential rains. Pam was over in Oakland visiting friends and, because of the A.C. Transit strike, was unable to get home that evening. None of the family thought Shorty's illness was as serious as it turned out to be--they all thought they had a tomorrow to look in on him. It was also said the autopsy showed he had cirrhosis of the liver (bartender Robinson said that Shorty drank Seagram's VO Scotch profusely and that the Seagram company should erect a monument in his honor).There were no funeral services held here in the city for Shorty. At the request of his mother, Mrs. Amanda Lee (remarried), who resides in Beaumont, Tex., his body was shipped to Carthage, Tex., where funeral services were held and where he joined the gravesite of his beloved father.Leo's body was on view at Coleman's Funeral Home here in the city, where many of the ""Greats, near greats, have-nots, and have-nothings"" stopped by to pay their last respects. Mr. Coleman tells me it was a ""lulu"" of a funeral.A quiet hour was held that evening at the funeral home, and the street that houses Coleman's was resplendent with Cadillacs, Rolls-Royces, and other fine wheels, as well as the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen wearing their furs and finest. They all came to say goodbye to the Mayor of Diviz. Members of the Franciscans Social Club were there, and I heard that Bunny Simmon, Fannie Sullivan, Harold Bordenave, Joe Lightfoot, and many, many more paid their respects. There were no eulogies, for everyone was stunned at his suffen passing; in fact this writer did not hear about his death until almost a week later.Shorty did not belong to a church in this city, but Rev. Robert Collier, of the Greater Little Chapel Church of God in Christ, located on Diviz across the street from the Sportsman Inn, said a few words in honor of Shorty.Last week I talked to Reverend Collier over the phone. He related to me that he and Shorty had become friends about three years ago. Many times Shorty would talk to him. If he had a problem, he would also discuss it with him. Shorty visited the church facility but never attended church services. Collier told me he tried to get Shorty to join the church, but he declined because he felt he was not ready to join the congregation but would when he felt that he was right within, spiritually. The reverend observed that Shorty was a generous and outgoing person. ""He was a friend to the church."" Whenever they had bazaars or other fund-raisers, Shorty would help them sell tickets, or bring people by the church to buy dinners or whatever else the church was trying to do. One Saturday afternoon between services Shorty brought former Sheriff Richard Hongisto over to the chapel to meet Rev. Collier. In introducing Hongisto to the minister, Shorty told Hongisto that the pastor was his friend.Rev. Collier said he spoke at the quiet hour services to comfort the family of Leo Roberts. He ended our conversation by saying, ""Shorty touched a lot of people. He was a friend.""On the eve of Leo ""Shorty"" Roberts's death, the Sportsman Inn and Watergate West closed their doors in mourning for their special friend.Shorty was loved and respected by many on the street scene and beyond, and for many, the following paragraph may express their feelings.In the closing of our conversation that fine Saturday afternoon at the Sportsman Inn, bartender Robinson eloquently voiced in a dignified manner a fitting eulogy for the Mayor of Diviz. ""The Black community has lost a great friend and a great cat! The Western Addition and Divisadero will never be the same. I don't think any Black man will be the same, for he touched their lives in some way every day!""Laura Mason softly sighed, ""He was a great lil fellow!"" Leo ""Shorty"" Roberts was a legendary ""lil fellow,"" who has left a vacant place that cannot be reoccupied.Photo (""Shorty"" Roberts' Family)","1978",0,0

You can prepare a spread that is so scrumptious and eye appealing that not one of your guest will ever realize that they are eating legal Weight Watchers fare. The key is in what you prepare and how you prepare it. This book let will tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. You're on the way to becoming the best barbecue chef in town Before getting into all of that ""good stuff"" that's on the following pages here are a few tips.Sizzling--from grill to plateGrilling is probably the quickest, and easiest way of cooking over a charcoal or wood fire. ""Control"" is the key word. Look out for flare-ups that burn meat--be sure to control them. It's the fat that drips on the coals that causes, flare-ups so steer clear of grilling meats that are fatty. That means frim all fats before placing over the hot coals. Avoid cooking over coals that are too close together. There should be a 1/2 to 1 inch space between briquets Make sure your coals are ash grey and space them so that they cover an areaslightly larger than that of the food on the grid.Skewer IIIThere's nothing more terrific than the combination of meat and vegetables on skewers. They're a delicious barbecue dinner with a gourmet air.The big trick is mounting the meat correctly. The best way to do this is to spear it on the main rod and hold if firmly in place with adjustbable holding forks. The meat must be balanced so the spit can turn without strain. It is essential to insert the rod through the center of gravity so the meat will turn with the rod and prevent the flopping which tears meat and stalls the motor Check the balance by holding the mounted meat with the end of the spit rod across the palms of your hands if the spit and meat de not totate easily simply remove the holding forks and remount.Whole Chicken on the SpitTie the wings over the breast push the spit thrgugh the bird from the tail end of the bird toward the front so that the point of the spit emerges between the branches of the wishbone Anchor the chicken to the spit with crossed drumsticks and tail tied together.

A 25-yard aerial from Graumann to a streaking Smith for a touchdown with 1:25 left in the game put out the Pacific North westerners valiant fire. Cal breathed a 21-18 sign when the hostilities ended.The Bears, 3-1 entering the game, had been warned by first year coach Roger Theder to expect a four-star performance from the winless Ducks but they paid little heed to him in the first half.""I told them that Oregon was probably the best 0-4 team in the nation,"" Theder said afterward in the happy dressing room. ""They are still the best 0-5 team in the nation.""The entire Bears' defensive unit went to the sleep on the second quarter. Oregon wide receiver, Paul Bachtold, in a moment of deceit, pretended to run off the Oregon side of the field. Instead, he line up near his team box and before Cal's secondary realized what had happened Bachtold was gathering Mike Kennedy's pass for an easy 52 yard TD.""That was Anthony Washington's man,"" Theder said. ""We had few words to say to him when he came back to the bench.Washington said Cal's defensive team broke out of its huddle a little late and he didn't see the wide receiver. That much was apparent.The Ducks added a field goal midway into the second quarter. English lauched a 35 yard splitting the uprights and the not-so-Golden Bears were looking at the short end of a 11-0 defecit when the half ended.The Strawberry Canyon faithful perked mightly when the Blues took the opening second half kickoff and marched 62 yards to Oregon's end zone cutting the margin to three points.Graumann entered the fray for sophomore sensation, Rich Campbell and guided the revitalized Bears to another score giving California its first lead 14-11.Momentum, an overused expression for outstanding play, shifted to the Bears as the insurgents from Oregon seemed overwhelmed by sheer numbers, Defensive stalwarts Ralph DeLoach and Pat Graham began to show why many experts have touted them for post season honors as they continually harrassed Kennedy.A Cal drive fizzled on the Oregon 32 yard line. Then Oregon rose up and blocked Joe Cooper's 39 yard field goal attempt.Once more the Bear defense was caught knapping. As they primed for a pass rush, Vince Williams took a quick handoff and bolted 36 yards for a touchdown to send Oregon in front once again, 18-14.Cooly, Graumann, the Moraga senior who had figured on being numero uno when the season began, took charge after the ensuing kickoff. He kept the Oregon defense honest with thrusts by fullback Paul Jones. Then he hit Lamar Lundy for 27 yards. Another Jones plunge up the middle gained eight. A miss to fleet Floyd Eddings was followed by Jones through center.A few seconds later, track star Smith, a member of Cal's 400 meter team last spring, cut in front of Oregon's Jerome Covington at the ten yard line caught Graumann's pass and sprinted into the end zone.Oregon's last gasp was stymied Anthony Washington's sixth interception of the year. And a smell of roses filled the air just when it seemed a rotten egg was going to spoil Cal's chances for a Rose Bowl bid.Photo (Bears And Duck Cut it Up)","1978",0,0
"790","",1978-01-01,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","The California Supreme Court has been asked to overturn a $4.3 billion school aid law aimed at eliminating district funding disparities based on its 1971 Serrano decision.John Serrano Jr's attorneys who argued successfully that some California property owners pay considerably higher tax rates than others to support local schools, claim the bill signed last September by Gov. Brown does not remove financial inequalities among the state's approximately 1,000 districts.John McDermott of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, one of Serrano's attorneys, described the bill Tuesday as ""a gigantic fraud on the taxpayers.""McDermott pointed out that enormous spending differences continue to exist between many districts, such as Beverly Hills and Baldwin Park, where a $1,200 difference would occur under the new measure.Without the measure, Beverly Hills residents each would pay a general purpose tax of $2.42 to raise $2,089 per student, while across Los Angeles in Baldwin Park, residents would pay $4.76 each, for $1,544 per student. The rates would change under the bill to $2.79 for $2,870 per student in Beverly Hills to $3.39 for $1.692 per student in Baldwin Park.The Bill, (AB65) which-becomes effective in 1981, attempts to remove tax and spending inequities in districts that enroll about 80 percent of the state's 4.3 million students by providing more state money to poor districts.Disparities occur because districts with more assessed value can pay relatively low tax rates to raise more money per student than districts with less assessed value.The action on behalf of Serrano seeks to require wealthy districts that continue to spend large amounts on public education to raise tax rates by a local vote to provide money for poorer neighbors.Serrano's lawyers have also asked the court to require that the state halt payments not required under the state constitution to wealthy districts, and that it redistribute the payments to poorer districts. In addition, the attorneys have requested a court order to redraw boundaries between districts to eliminate funding differences.The court last year upheld a contention by McDermott's group and Public Advocates of San Francisco that current school district funding violates equal protection provisions of the state constitutions.","1978",0,1

In fact, she told the friend, or husband, that it was an outright attempt of rape.This startling announcement by the alleged victim served only to bring about an acrimonious dispute between the alleged victim and her husband/friend.The husband/friend, it appears, questioned the credibility of the alleged victim to such an extent that he took steps to improve her integrity.The husband/friend attacked the alleged victim physically, by launching a fist attack on her, which resulted in her being knocked to the floor. The victim was then rolled on the bed and the now enraged husband/friend began to kick the victim about the body. Police said he was barefoot, which perhaps prevented the victim from receiving serious injuries.The now enraged husband/friend announced to the victim that he was going to give her a lesson and show her what violent rape was all about. The attacker then proceeded to have forcible rape with the victim. The victim later informed the police that her husband/friend has used his teeth to bite her several times during the affray and that she had numerous scratches on her body.Following satiation by the suspect, the victim fled the premises and went to the home of her mother, from where she called the police. She was taken to Central Emergency Hospital for treatment. The husband/friend was picked up by police and detained for investigation.Paul Robertson, a 33-year-old employee of the Viking Sandwich Shop located at 1405 Van Ness Avenue, was subjected to the type of trauma that victims of armed robbery and muggings receive when they are the victims of these types of crimes by the predators who roam the streets of every major American city.Robertson was on duty a fortnight ago when two unidentified males walked into the establishment.One of the unidentified males produced what appeared to be an automatic handgun and informed Robertson that he wanted all of the money removed from the cash register, police said.The other unidentified male kept his hands in the pocket of his jacket stimulating that he too had a handgun. He moved behind the counter where he saw a safe. The suspect behind the counter ordered Robertson to open the safe and empty if of all monies. Robertson complied with both orders. The bandits received a total of $100.Robertson then was commanded to lay face down on the floor and the bandits rushed out of the place, after Robertson complied with the last order.Robertson then called the police after ascertaining that his unwelcome guests had made their departure.The Fotomat company has a number of outlets in the city where amateur photographers can bring their films and have them developed for a nominal fee. One such outlet is located at 200 Sickles Avenue.Veronica Thorne was on duty when the incident which was brought to the attention of the police occurred.Two unidentified females entered the establishment and, since they were, in the mind of Veronica, like any other customers, she asked one of them could she be of any assistance.One of the females answered Veronica in a most abrupt manner by saying that she had entered the place to rob her.The suspect intimidated Veronica by displaying a black object in her hand. Veronica thought that it looked like a handgun and did not offer any resistance.Veronica opened the cash box and emptied it of all the monies, which the suspect took.The female bandit and her partner then made their departure.Veronica called the police and made a report. She informed police that the gunwoman was the same suspect who had robbed her on a previous occasion and that the suspects had escaped in a white Lincoln Continental.Veronica must have noticed the license number of the vehicle, for the police began a wide-spread investigation which led them to arresting Angela Green.","1979",0,0

"799","James",1979-03-30,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","GAS SAVINGS TIPS...According to James . . . records, many automobile buyers in the past have driven their cars purchased from James Pontiac without service. The records reveal customers go beyond the required time for tune-ups, oil change, tire rotation and lubrication. This has many bad results when returning the car for trade-in on another model or for service. Here then are ways to help you keep your car in good running condition and help to save gasoline.1-Avoid stop and go with quick starts as much as possible.2-When driving on the freeway try to maintain a steady speed of 55 miles per hour (speed limit by law) rather than fluctuating from 50 to 60 miles per hour. Try to keep adequate distance behind the car in front so that steady speed is maintained.3-Use cruise control when driving on the freeway if traffic is not too congested.4-Have your automobile serviced completely at proper intervals. You should have your car serviced by the dealer from whom you purchased the car, since they have the complete records on the car. Be sure they are an authorized dealer representative for your particular make of automobile. Having old sparks plugs, wiring, electrical system, fuel pump will detract from proper performance of your automobile. Another bad habit of most drivers is to let dirty oil and missed lubrication of parts run their automobile into the problem area. Proper weight of oil and lubrication gives better miles per gallon.5-Tire inspection for adequate tread and pressure is very important to gas saving driving.6-Transmission service should be checked at proper intervals for dirty oil, dirty filter, which could cause slippage in the gears and wear on other parts of the transmission.Following these guidelines could save you in the long run in the gasoline price war.","1979",0,0

In addition to medical teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, technicians and researchers, hospitals are staffed by hundreds of people whose jobs are more diversified than many major corporations.Currently the American Hospital Association lists more than 200 job classifications for hospital workers. Accountants, engineers, social workers, dietitians, financial counselors, office workers, communications and recordkeeping specialists are just part of the modern hospital team. Whether you are deciding upon a career, contemplating a mid-career change, or seeking part-time or volunteer work, as hospitals continue to expand, so will the need for service-oriented people to staff them.Behind the day to day operations of a hospital is the engineering staff who ensure that hospital equipment and facilities are always in readiness for the care and treatment of patients. For examples Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley employs 20-22 engineers over a 24-hour period including painters, plant operators, maintenance engineers, refrigeration and air condition personnel, bio-medical technicians, plumbers and carpenters.Engineer Earl Baker came to Alta Bates Hospital 18 years ago, started as a surgical orderly and in 1971 was asked to work in the engineering department as a cabinetmaker's apprentice. With a background in construction, his skills have been broadened through building, finishing and repairing furniture and hospital fixtures and securing equipment against theft.Earl notes that working for institutions such as hospitals provide a permanent year-round job, and that the biggest advantage to working in the engineering department is the variety of things to do. ""It is extremely challenging--no routine. You also learn about plumbing, electrical work..."" Being a hospital carpenter is similar to being a jack-of-all-trades. You have to be a cabinetmaker. keymaker, cement man--familiar with all forms of construction.He pointed out that his work enables him to deal with all the departments and units in the hospital. ""I was surprised to find out the amount of work and interaction between departments. Regardless of level, people are concerned about patients and their care.""In order to enter the field of hospital engineering, you must start out as an apprentice in the Stationary Engineer's Union taking a statecontrolled test to become eligible for the program. A minimum age of 18 years and a high school diploma, GED equivalent or trade school certificate are also required. Because of the nature of the work, mechanical aptitude, manual dexterity and good physical condition are highly desirable qualities.After successfully completing the test, you are put on a waiting list. Hospitals employ both apprentices and journeymen and notify the union when openings occur. Once selected, you need to apply for union membership within 30 days.The four-year apprentice program involves approximately 8,000 hours ""on-the-job"" training plus over 575 classroom hours. In San Francisco and Oakland, college credit is given towards a degree from a community college. At the conclusion of the apprenticeship, the prospective engineer takes the journeyman's test. Journeyman salary is currently a growing field in the Stationary engineer's Union is the bio-medical technician, who maintains critical medical equipment such as the heartlung machine and cardiac monitor. The bio-medical technician needs additional courses in advanced electronics, medical electronics, human anatomy and physiology.Photo (American Hospitals employ engineers like Earl Baker, who ensure on a 24-hour basis that hospital equipment and facilities are always in readiness for the care and treatment of patients.)","1979",0,0

Carl Bernstein and Robert Woodard, reporters for the Washington Post, became household names for their outstanding investigation of the break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters.Now, Great Britain has Oilgate. Through the efforts and diligence of Bernard Rivers and Martin Bailey, two freelance reporters, at the time, the British government finds itself involved in the most embarassing scandal since the revelations of Joseph Profumo.The British were caught literally with their oil pans down. Following Rhodesia's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth in 1965, economic sanctions (trade embargos) were imposed on lan Smith's regime by all members of the United Nations except Portugal and South Africa. To fortify their position, the consenting countries introduced laws banning trade with Rhodesia in oil and most other goods.Instead of being brought to their economic knees begging for assistance, the Rhodesians, one of two African countries, until recently, under minority white rule, continued to prosper.Their tables were filled with food; their vehicles continued to run, and their armed forces, army, navy, and air force, never missed a chance, over the last decade, to stamp out any insurrection by the native Africans in the country.Modern industralized civilizations need oil to sustain its way of life. Only a few privileged knew how Rhodesia, in spite of the sanction, was able to obtain the precious Black gold.About four years ago, a curious Rivers decided he would begin a one-man campaign to ferret out the truth.His determination, along with Bailey who joined him two years later, was rewarded last year with the British Broad-casting Company's Investigative Journalist of the Year Award. The pair also received the Journalist of the Year Award at the British Press Awards annual luncheon.River who was in San Francisco this week to speak at the Standard Oil of California stockholders' meeting, said the assignment was the most difficult that he had ever undertaken.""It was a tough investigation,"" he said. ""Most of the people I interviewed were stubborn.""I almost gave up at the end of two years because I had used up most of the money I had saved,"" said the 32-year old economist-author.Bailey came along about that time and asked him to keep up his work. The british government now wishes he had left well enough alone.Government officials faces are grease-smeared because the investigation revealed that 50 percent of the oil lubricating the machine guns in Rhodesia came from Great Britain.In fact, British Petroleum, a government owned and operated oil company, supplied 25 percent of the oil used in Rhodesia.Five oil companies were maintaining the economy of Rhodesia: Shell (Dutch-British), Total (French) and American companies Mobil and Caltex (Standard Oil of California and Texaco).""We were also lucky,"" said Rivers. ""We were fortunate enough to have our equivalent of ""Deep Throat.""""Deep Throat"" was an invaluable asset to Woodard and Berstein while they were investigating Watergate. He was a high ranking government official who not only supplied leads but steered them in the right direction. His identity has never been revealed.In Oilgate, Rivers said, their source worked for Mobil in Africa. He was a tremendous help to the reporters.The oil did not go directly to Rhodesia, the reporters learned. The five companies sent the oil to their South African subsidiaries.The subsidiaries then sold the oil to Freight Service Ltd. the intermediary company, primarily a transportation firm, simply delivered the refined oil to Rhodesian warehouses. Mobil supplied about 100,000 tons a year to Rhodesia through this method.Further investigation revealed that Shell sent 120,000 tons, BP 120,000, Caltex 100,000, and Total 50,000.The American companies denied the allegation, naturally. The British maintained a stiff upper lip, at first.Then a prominent British attorney, Thomas Bingham, initiated a formal inquiry, perhaps to silence the notorious reporters once and for all.""I think the report was to be kept secret,"" Rivers said. ""But we received a copy of the 100 page BP report from a friend.""With the report in their hands, the two crusaders headed for the London Times office. The Times was very happy to receive the ""scoop.""The Bingham report, published in September, 1978, confirmed that the South African subsidiaries of Shell and BP had supplied Rhodesia with oil through Freight Services. The report also revealed that Shell and BP offices in London had been aware of the scheme, had condoned it, and had informed the British government of most of its details.Similar investigations by the U.S. Treasury Department have been stifled by the South African Official Secrets Act. Although owned by corporations in the United States, the South African subsidiaries claim that they cannot reveal their dealings because this law forbids them. That's like a child telling a parent he doesn't have to tell where he or she has been.Nevertheless, a group of stockholders of Socal introduced a resolution at their meeting this week to cut South Africa's oil allocation 33 prcent. They said considering that Caltex gave Rhodesia four percent of its oil for the last ten years, 40 percent, during the years the sanction was on, South Africa should be willing to get along on less. The resolution failed.There are a few people who think South Africa shouldn't get any American oil. Including Rivers and a whole bunch of motorists who are lining up each day to purchase that high priced necessity.","1979",0,1
"804","",1979-06-28,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Stanford historian Clayborne Carson acknowledges that the freedom rides campaign of 1961 was begun by an organization, namely CORE, which sent a small group of activists into the South to protest segregation policies at Southern bus stations.""But it is important to note,"" he said, ""that after white racists in Alabama burned one of the buses in Alabama and almost lynched the passengers, CORE abandoned the rides. Only then did it become a movement, for at that point Black college students decided to continue the rides.""The freedom rides campaign was a small movement in comparison with the bus boycott and the sit-ins, Carson said, but it was perhaps more important in that it required high levels of commitment and courage to take the Black struggle into an area where white resistance was most vicious.""These students did not require leaders or organizations to direct their activities. In fact they resisted such attempts.""With the exception of SNCC, the major civil rights organizations and Martin Luther King tried to dissuade the students from continuing to fill the Mississippi jails.""The freedom ride movement also brought the civil rights movement into the Deep South where Black residents were preparing on their own to launch the next stage of the Black struggle,"" Carson maintained.Far from being integrationist in orientation, the Black activists in the freedom ride campaign had begun to challenge the liberal assumptions about racial reform of the administration of John Kennedy, placing it on the defensive.Following all these developments Black residents in the Deep South made efforts to exercise their political rights despite racist intimidation, and in this stage, too, Black residents mobilized themselves with little outside assistance.""The most important organization in these areas was SNCC,"" Carson stated, ""but SNCC's philosophy of struggle was different from that of the NAACP or CORE or SCLC. SNCC workers such as Bob Moses, a Black graduate student at Harvard University before coming to Mississippi, believed that organizers should develop local leadership rather than making local residents dependent on outside leaders.""King would come to town and provoke a crisis thorough his charismatic ability to bring people into the streets, but Bob Moses was one of the SNCC workers who established themselves in communities, gained the trust of local residents, and remained to assist them rather than assume leadership of their struggles.""Although most people think of the Black voter registration drives as integrationist since they were part of the civil rights movement, Carson maintains that it was during the course of these drives that the first significant Black-controlled independent political organizations of the '60s emerged.The tactics of voter registration in the Deep South involved mass meetings and armed self defense rather than passive resistance.""The voter registration campaign was not initiated by national civil rights leaders,"" Carson said, ""but it produced many of the Black leaders who still are the leadership of the Black South.""Carson said the Black uprisings, which paralyzed many American cities during the '60s, actually began in the South in the early 60s and moved to the North instead of vice versa.""The Black urban rebellions, unlike earlier Black struggles, did not produce many sigificant leaders. Perhaps this is because they were not sustained long enough to allow indigenous leadership to develop.""The Black leaders who claimed later to speak in the name of the discontented urban Blacks rarely played a significant role in leading Black urban rebellions.""However, the urban rebellions were definitely not integrationist in orientation. Thus it is probably most accurate to say that ideologies that accurately reflected the sentiments of discontented urban Blacks probably did not have time to emerge,"" Carson said.Although Malcolm X was an important leader during this time, according to Carson, he never led a massive Black struggle for social change.""It was claimed that Macolm X was the only Black man in America who could stop a race riot or start one, but he writes in his autobiography that he didn't know if he could do either one. And he never had a chance to really try.""Carson said Malcolm X broke from the Nation of Islam because he felt that the Black nationalist group was not playing aprogressive role in the Black struggle.""Toward the end of his life Malcolm tried to overcome this deficiency of nationalist leadership by establishing ties with the Southern civil rights movement,"" according to Carson. ""Among his last actions, months before his death, was to bring young Southern activists from the civil rights movement to New York to meet with him.""After this he went into the South and went into Selma and played a role in the Southern movement. It is clear that his intention was to set up an organic link between his own organization and the Southern struggle, to send people into that struggle, to get training in a national ongoing social movement and also to bring people out of that struggle so that they could gain greater political sophistication.""But rather than seeking to impose his own ideology on the Southern movement, Malcolm attempted to encourage the ideological tendencies that were already present,"" Carson said.Did a nationalist ideology unify the Black struggle?""It is certainly the case that during 1965 an enormously important transformation of Black political consciousness occurred,"" Carson answers.""By that year Malcolm X, in death, had become the patron saint of the Black movement. The next year Stokeley Carmichael had captured the imagination of Blacks with the Black power slogan. Black student unions and Black United Fronts were begun.""It was also during this period, however, that Black leadership became divided over ideological questions. As they argued about whether Blacks should follow a cultural nationalist or class strategy, Black people themselves were moving ahead without them.""Rather than seeking to identify the emergent ideas of the urban Black movement, Black leaders typically competed with each other to impose their own doctrines upon urban Blacks. The result was not to unify but instead to fester internal conflicts that could be exploited by the white establishment.""Carson said white repression did bring an end to this era, but only partially.The Black urban rebellions were easily suppressed because capable leaders and resilient institutions did not emerge from these struggles. Covert intelligence operations by the FBI succeeded because they could exploit distrust and confusion that already existed.The targets of government repression were not Black separatist ideas of movement but rather leaders who were thought to be capable to unifying Black people, Carson pointed out. The irony of the Colntel Program was that it was often directed against groups and leaders who had no mass Black following or were losing the following they once had due to their insistence on taking ideological positions that separated them from the masses of Black people.""By the time Richard Nixon was elected to office in 1968, the Black struggles of the 60s had come to an end, but Nixon should not be given credit for this,"" according to Carson.""Black people survived,"" even if leaders sometimes did not. Therefore, it is often useful for leaders to learn from those they want to lead.""There is a pervasive arrogance among many of those who consider themselves ideologically aware Black people. This arrogance is rooted in the assumption that ordinary Black people, being at a lower stage of ideological development, should be taught political doctrines or cultural valves in order to prepare them for future struggle, rather than recognizing that the best doctrines for struggle are those that emerge from the previous struggles of people.""These doctrines do not fit into any preformed ""isms,"" according to Carson. When ideas become doctrines, when militancy becomes cant, it is the first indication that ideas are losing potential to move people to action.","1979",0,1
"805","Clay, William L",1979-06-21,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","It's about time the nation's chief inflation fighters get out of the gym and into the ring. As long as President Carter only practices his inflation fighting on the poor he will never get is shape to take on the real champion.Using the unemployed as punching bags will not tighten his muscles for the real Ali of the federal budget: The Pentagon. Skipping rope with federal employees' cost of living increases will not sharpen his footwork for the unbeaten war machine of the defense spenders.If, and I say if, Mr. Carter is serious about his most important fight in his short career then he must train in earnest. Surely he knows that the champ is proficient in the art of ducking and dodging. So far the military budget has been untouched by the President's left jabs in the fight against inflation.Not once has Mr. Carter attacked military spending as the most inflationary element in the entire economy. He has not even hinted that the Pentagon drives prices way up by excessively spending dollars, but producing no goods for services. Inefficiency and waste are the military's two best punches. But Mr. Carter's fight game plan is to stay out of the Pentagon's way by use of fancy footwork.In fact, Las Vegas gamblers are giving ten to one odds that Carter will not lay a glove on the $25 billion annual waste, duplication and cost overrun of the defense budget. They are giving five to one odds that in the first round of the budget fight, he will be successful in cutting funds for education, food stamps, housing and social security recipients.The odds escalate to eight to one that by round four the Pentagon will have Mr. Carter on the ropes pleading for an even larger increase in defense spending. Despite the fact that spending for war is capital intensive, Mr. Carter will shout to his trainers that only a billion dollars more in defense will produce 48,000 jobs. And his crafty trainees whom some suspect of fixing fights surely will not inform the staggering President that one billion dollars spent in the private sector will create almost 100,000 jobs.Zing magazine has quoted Jimmy the Greek as saying.""Jimmy, the former champion of the Georgian Gloves will to TKOed in the tenth round."" The Greek described the gory battle in typical fisticuff jargon. He said, ""Jimmy was maneuverred into a neutral corner, pulverized by a series of rights and lefts which sent most domestic programs reeling.A glassy-eyed Jimmy Carter could not see how $10 billion more for defense would knock down his chances of providing adequate medical care for all citizens regardless of ability to pay. A bleeding nose, not a bleeding heart was evidence that the President had gallantly fought in vain to preserve 250,000 summer jobs for disadvantaged youth.""Certainly all the predictions of the ring-wise protectors of an overkill defense budget will come true if the average citizen does not inform his or her representative in Congress that President Carter's misdirected punches and his ineffective infighting will reek havoc on the economy.","1979",0,1

""There aren't any promotional exam, so upgrading is done on a popularity basis with the minorities already having a strike against them,"" the group said.Rather than promote a Black to vault teller, through normal channels, Luring had to be pressured by minority employees. The employees said Luring told them he would only make the promotion under the affirmative action program.""Three others were considered for the job, all members of the majority, a kitchen helper, a postal employee, and a cab driver,"" tthe spokesperson said. ""The man who finally received the appointment had 15 years experience as a bridge officer and an outstanding work record.""Currently, the spokesman said, there are approximately 181 minority persons, including 85 bus drivers and nine bridge officers, employed as toll takers. The current hiring list has expired and contained no minority names. The bridge management has stopped taking applications.The Urban Mass Transit Authority has requested that the bridge authority make a conscious effort to fill management level jobs with minority persons, the spokesman said.The position of chief of security was only recently filled temporarily by former San Francisco Police Captain Augustus Brunneman. The spokesperson said Lieutenant Henry Williams of the SFPD also applied for the job.Williams had been a member of the Community Relations Detail for years before assuming the head of the department but, according to the spokesperson, was categorized as being ""just a beat cop.""""The managers on the bridge want to keep Blacks and other minorities relegated to menial jobs,"" the spokesperson said.A majority of the group felt the bridge authority would be forced to adhere to the hiring practices perscribed by law if there were a Black commissioner appointed by Mayor Feinstein to the board. Superior Court Judge John Dearman sat on the board for several years before his appointment to the Municipal Court.Four members of the board of supervisors sit on the board plus five persons appointed by the San Francisco's Mayor. The group saw a ray of hope when Supervisor Ella Hutch applied but she was turned down as her colleagues, Bob Molinar, Ron Pelosi, Bob Gonzales, and Quentin Kopp, retained their seats.With an election in November, the bridge authority workers would like to know what the candidates for Mayor are going to do about the ""rag tag"" hiring practices of the GGBA.""I don't see how there can be a board in this area comprised of 19 commissioners that does not have a single minority on it,"" the spokesperson said.

'the American people must face the reality of increasing shortages and higher prices in crude oil.""That straight-from-the-shoulder declaration was brought to San Francisco by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, D-LA, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Regulation which has primary jurisdiction over the majority of the administration's National Energy Plan.Speaking to 350 men and women at the Awards Luncheon of the American Petroleum Institute's conference at the San Francisco Hilton, Johnston warned that simple solutions to the nation's energy problems just do not exist.""The American people and the American government have some hard decisions to make. The facts are really obvious. There is a price to be paid both in terms of cost and in terms of environment and the decisions must be made now,"" Johnaton emphasized.He warned that the ""biggest price of all is not to have energy.""""If we continue the present policy of not making these decisions, we will the beginning of the decline of American power, the beginning of the and of the American dream,"" Johnston continued.Johnston's speech covered four areas: supply of oil, refinery legislation, crude oil decontrol and a general overview of the energy outlook for the United States.Johnston said his subcommittee is beginning hearings Monday on production and supply.""First we will get the information and then we will try to impart this information to the American public in a credible and reasonable way,"" Johnaton said.He sees this as a problem that will be hard to solve, though.""The credibility of government statements is very low,"" he said.""In the United States, there is suspicion, hostility, lack of belief and downright antipathy toward all people in positions of authority. This attitude tends to immobilize authority and also action.""Johnston then cited some statistics he urged the American people to heed.""Since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the demand for oil has increased 9.3 per cent because there are 23 million additional automobiles on the road and because of a requirement unique in the United States for unleaded gas which takes more crude oil to manufacture.""Presently there is a reserve of 231.8 million barrels of regular gas. Herein lies the credibility with the people. They wonder why the oil companies are stockpiling.""But this is not a stockpile.It is a reserve to see that we do not run out of gas entirely. This figure is down 7.2 per cent over last year and 10 percent below the projected normal. It is right at the minimum acceptable level,"" Johnston said.""The same is true for distillates from which diesel and home heating oils are manufactured. They are down 15.3 per cent from 1978 and 16 per cent below projected normals. They are far below the minimum . . . level.""For this reason Carter is asking refineries to switch over and produce distillates. This must be done and if refineries do not do it voluntarily Carter will use legal power to require the switchover,"" Johnston continued.""The result is that things will be tighter this late summer and even tighter by next summer,"" Johnston concluded.Touching on refinery legislation, Johnston said legislation is badly needed to encourage building of new expanded refineries so that the United States does not become dependent on foreign refineries.""As long as crude oil is kept at a subsidized low price"" he incentive to develop other sources of energy does not exist, Johnston explained.""In spite of all the statements. I think decontrol will be all right."" Johnston concluded.","1979",0,0

The cost to registered an unaltered cat will be $10; a spayed cat would cost $5. Senior citizens would be able to license their cats for $2.50.The plan now goes to the Board of Supervisors for consideration.

The Health and Environment Committee, headed by Supervisor Louise Renne, will study the plan before passing it on to the full board for consideration.The plan may run into some opposition from cat lovers who consider licensing an affront to their independent pets.""I would think it's going to be unpopular."" Supervisor Renne said ""but animal protection is in need of money post Proposition 13.""""We'll have to take a look at the need for this kind of proposal,"" Renne said. ""Next, assuming that it's necessary, what are the alternatives?""She suggested that charging pet owners for the return of their animals might be an alternative to the licensing fee.Lcensing may rub some fur the wrong way, but Richard Avanzino, the executive director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in San Francisco, is in full favor of the plan, but not because of the revenue it will bring in.""The SPCA did not propose it; we are not going to be involved in issuing licenses. We try to save lives,"" Avanzino explained.Citing SPCA statistics from the past six months, Avanzino pointed out that 88 percent of the city's lost dogs are returned to their owners, as opposed to a three percent return rate for lost cats. Dogs have identification tags, cats do not.Most of the unreturned cats were successfully given away, Avanzino said, but more than 200 healthy animals had to be killed.""If these animals were wearing identification tags, we wouldn't have had to kill a single one,"" he said.In response to critics who say that the program would be unenforcable, Avanzino said that the program would work by voluntary compliance, not enforcement.""It would be done primarily by relying on responsible pet owners,"" Avanzino explained. ""Personally, as far as we're concerned, licensing is a sign of concern and affection.""Anna Tonneson, a member of the Animal Control and Welfare Commission who voted in favor of the plan, called it ""fair and equitable.""She also pointed out that the licensing fee would allow cat owners to halp maintain the city's animal programs which are now funded mostly by dog licenses.Cat owners may feel conspired against. Tonneson said she picked up a ""CIA feeling"" from the audience at the commission hearing. But according to Avanzino, cats without tags would not be impounded.

"822","",1979-03-29,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","Hopes of minorities and women for a fair shake in the job market may be doomed if a ruling now on appeal to the United States Supreme Court is sustained. So says the Northern California Coalition . . . Overturn the Weber Case, a coalition of community, labor, student and church organizations.Arguments in the case of Weber versus Kaiser Aluminum--which some have labeled ""Son of Bakke""--were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday. A decision is expected in June.The action was brought by Brian Weber, a white worker at Kaiser's Gramercy, Louisiana, plant who sued Kaiser and the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) claiming ""reverse discrimination."" He charged that the collectively-bargained affirmative action plan of Kaiser and the USWA violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the plan gave preference to Black workers over white workers with greater seniority.The agreement set up an on-the-job training (OJT) program for skilled craft positions, designed to admit whites and Blacks on a one-to-one basis. Candidates would be admitted from separate Black and white seniority lists until the percentage of Black skilled workers matched the Black population surrounding the plant.Under the negotiated affirmative action plan. Weber was denied admission to the OJT program while Blacks with less seniority were admitted.The historic discrimination in the steel and in the aluminum industries resulted in a disparity of job opportunities. At the Gramercy plant, the discrimination against Blacks was also longstanding. Opened in 1958, the Gramercy plant was located in a community whose population was 40% Black. At the plant in 1969, only 10% of the work force was Black and this rose to 14.8% by 1974. Prior to 1974, only 5 of the 273 craft positions. approximately 2%, were held by Blacks.Only after intense government pressure which represented a loss of millions of dollars in government contracts, and after minorities demanded access to the craft positions, did Kaiser and USWA finally agree to an affirmative action program.Despite the glaring discrepancy in job opportunities, the lower courts found that there was no discrimination against Blacks by Kaiser since two Kaiser personnel officials, the only witnesses called by Kaiser and the USWA, said that Kaiser never discriminated. The courts then decided that without a history of discrimination at the plant, the Affirmative Action plan amounted to ""reverse discrimination"" and was thus illegal.THE REAL ISSUEAccording to Coalition member. Lorenza Carlisle, a machinist at Caterpillar Tractor Company, ""the real issue in the Weber case is not whether Weber was a victim of ""reverse discrimination"" but whether programs which force employers to remedy racial and sexual discrimination by hiring or promoting qualified women and minorities are legal. Should racism and women's oppression go unchecked?"" she asks.The Coalition claims that Affirmative Action plans were established only after the Civil Rights movements of the 1950's and 1960's pressured the government and business to end discrimination in employment. Such programs were seen as a means to reduce the inequality between minorities and whites and between men and women.Weber himself, the Coalition charges, was a direct beneficiary of the affirmative action plan. ""Before the affirmative action agreement, neither Black nor white unskilled employees--such as Weber-had any chance of moving up into skilled jobs"", pointed out Carlisle. ""The Affirmative action plan gave him and all the people at Kaiser an equal chance at upgrading on a seniority basis."" Before 1974, access to the skilled jobs were determined solely by prior craft experience with no consideration for seniority. Hence, no preference was previously given to the employees of Kaiser.""REVERSE DISCRIMINATION""Opponents of Affirmative Action, like Weber, claim that these plans have gone too far and are unfair because they constitute ""reverse discrimination"". But have they gone too far? Coalition member, Bill Tamayo, states, ""The facts say no. Minority income is still 60% of white income, unemployment for Blacks is more than double that of whites. Another generation of minority youth is being condemned to the streets by joblessness. Women earn 57% of male wages; a college-educated woman makes the same as a man who only finishes the 8th grade. Clearly programs which combal these inequalities need to be expanded, not eliminated.""""THE IMPACTIf the Supreme Court up-holds the ruling in the Weber Case, some 30,000 voluntary affirmative action plans affecting 30 million workers could be struck down. In effect, the courts seem to be saying that it is illegal to form a labor agreement to rectify glaring discrimination like Kaiser's. The Coalition believes that the case is more-far-reaching and dangerous than Bakke.WHAT CAN BE DONE?The Coalition believes that only through mass pressure aimed at the U.S. Supreme Court can the Weber decision be reversed. Should Weber win, minorities and women would be trapped at the bottom rungs of the employment ladder and once again, locked into the pattern of ""last hired, first fired"".""We can't afford to be setback 50 or more years. History has taught us that only if we unit and organize those who are opposed to racism and sexism can we hope to overturn decisions like Weber,"" noted Carlisle.","1979",0,1

It was dismal performance for the hard-hitting Warren, Ohio, resident. He knew it and has been chasing Holmes, taunting him every chance he can get.Shortly before Shaver annihilated former WBC champion Ken Norton in Las Vegas last March, Shavers told Holmes that he wished him luck with Ossie Ocasio because he wanted him next. Holmes only laughed but he will have to do more than that when the two fighters get together Friday at Caesar's Palace.'I wasn't in shape the last time,' Shavers, said. My manager Frank Luca didn't want to spend any money so I didn't have good facilities.'We had small quarters and didn't come out to Las Vegas until a few days before the fight,' Shavers continued, feeling more disgusted as he remembered the earlier contest.Shavers said he has thought about getting Holmes in the ring many times since that day. He said he has been working on his stamina and his strength with his new manager.He said he doesn't think there is a harder puncher in the fight game than he is, if he has trained properly.The champion, unbeaten in 31 battles, is a fierce competitor. He displayed his courage in the terrific non-stop battle with Ken Norton last year. After setting a torrid pace in the early rounds. Holmes appeared to run out of gas as Norton began to punish him in the middle rounds.It seemed only a matter of time before the pride of Easton, Pa, would be wallowing in the sawdust of Caesar's ring. From that unknown place within the human spirit that champions summon courage from, Holmes reached out and found some. The final three rounds of bout were considered by most ringsiders as the greatest ever witnessed in heavyweight title contest. Going into the last round, each of the judges had the fight even. Only on the strength of Holmes' last round heroics did he wrest the title from Norton.Since taking over the title, Holmes, who is not noted as a puncher, 22 knockouts, demolished his last two challengers. Ossie Ocasio left in eight stanzas and L.A. strongboy Mike Weaver lasted until the 12th round.Holmes claims he has found the secret to punching harder. That may be true. Shavers, who has 56 KO's in 58 wins, has been knocked out three times. Ron Lyle put him out for the count the last time September 13, 1975. He has been more durable since then. However, Holmes, with his new dynamic punching power, said he can knock the bald-headed Shavers out of contention.Besides the heavyweight title match, super promoter Don King has lined up a superb card. Unbeaten welterweight Sugar Ray Leonard takes on stylist Andy Price of Los Angeles.Leonard, 24-0, was the 139-pound 1976 Olympic champion. He has been a crowd pleaser, he has sent 15 of his opponents home early. In his last appearance in the same ring, he stopped Sacramento's Pete Razany in four rounds.Price has won 32 of his 40 bouts, ten by knock outs. He has a win over Pipino Cuevas, the hard-hitting WBA welterweight champion. He has also beaten former WBC welter kingpin Carlos Palomino. And by virtue of his two victories over those two highly rated battlers, 'the Hawk', as Price is called, has been called the 'uncrowned welterweight champion.' Leonard will have his hands full.Photo (Super promoter Don King with PUSH's Reverend Jesse Jackson.)","1979",0,0

"826","",1979-12-20,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","How much does modern music owe Sylvester Stewart? ""A lot,"" he asserts, and no one with the slightest sense of history can deny it. Rock, R&B, disco, pop, fusion: there is something in each of these expressions that reflects the musical impulse of this one man. Integrating, synthesizing, borrowing, formulating--somewhere in those processes Sly Stone emerged with a wholly new sound, a sound still reverberating across the nation in a spectrum of contemporary music.It was a rare combination of elements--geographic, cultural and creative. In the San Francisco Bay Area it was the Golden Age, when on one side of the water, the Haight-Ashbury served as the spiritual hub of a generation's emergence, and on the other, in Oakland and the East Bay, the heat of a growing Black awareness was peeling away decades of formalized repression. Somehow the two had to coalise, the creative sum equaling more than the parts. Rock and soul would merge and the resulting sound would unify even as it shattered conventions and preconceptions.This Herculean undertaking was accomplished singlehandedly by a young man born in Texas and raised in the hardnosed factory town of Vallejo, California. It could well have been a musical theory course in high school that sparked the genius of Sly Stone, but who can say for sure how such things happen? All that is finally known are the facts of history: how Sly landed a job with the seminal psychedelic air personality Tom Donahue, who at the time headed up a local label called Autumn Records. It was there Sly got firsthand experience nurturing the infant music of the new age, producing local rock bands like the Mojo Men, the Vejtables and the Beau Brummels, turning out local, regional and finally national hits.As a DJ at an Oakland soul station. Sly continued the process of synthesis and creation, mixing Motown and Stax staples with Dylan, Beatles and the Stones. His on-the-air persona reflected a single, overwhelming fact, as anyone who heard those historic broadcasts will testify: Sly was a man with a vision. It was a vision that called for nothing less than a revolutionary restructuring of musical, cultural and political values, a dissembling of barriers and a passionate call to arms. It was a vision called Sly & The Family Stone.The band consisted of Sly, his brother Freddie and his sister Rose, Jerry Martini and his cousin Gregg Errico, Cynthia Robinson and Larry Graham, later to find fame as the founder of Graham Central Station. From the beginning it was clear; the group intended to disassemble stereotypes of race, gender and musical categories with a swift, telling strike at the heart of the status quo. Women sang and played horns, men sang, played and dressed in an outrageous rendering of hippie regalia, Blacks and whites moved together onstage, and the music...the music delivered on its promise in so spectacular a fashion that there was, for a brief and glorious moment, simply no name for it. ""Dance To The Music."" released in 1968, scattered conventional filing methods to the four winds even as it fused the resonant powers of rock and R&B into a single, exuberant whole, upping the wattage to the tenth power in the process.Photo (SLY STONE)","1979",0,0

The fact is Freddie loves music and while it may be too early to say that music is Freddie James' life, one thing is certain; Freddie James, by the twin facts of his age and his talents, is going to be around for a long time.Born April 26, 1964, in Chicago, III., Freddie is the son of a singing Mom and a bass-playing Dad. His mother, Geraldine Hunt, was well known in the Chicago area for her nightclub appearances, while his father performed with Jerry Butler. Freddie's first musical experience came at age five, when he and his cousin, Donell Brown, were spotted by a talent agent as they mimed and danced to a Jackson Five hit. The agent asked the boys if they'd like to go on television, and like any five-year-old kids, they jumped at the chance.Freddie and Donell pantomimed the Jackson Five hit they had done in Freddie's bedroom this time before millions on the television show Soul Train. The experience gave them both a lot of confidence and they soon brought their act to talent shows in and around the Chicago area, playing for the coins people would toss onto the stage.Unfortunately, Freddie's budding career was slowed by a childhood illness that kept him out of action for almost three years. All during that time, however, he received encouragement both from his mother and his grandmother, who continually stressed that his vocal talents were worth developing. After recovering from his sickness, Freddie began working hard at singing, participating long hours in between school work.When Freddie was eight, his mother went on tour with the International Inkspots, a tour that included a stop in Montreal. His parents had previously been separated and it was here that his mother was to meet Freddie's future step-father, a Montreal optometrist.The family--Freddie, his sister, mother and grandmother-relocated in Montreal, and shortly afterwards, Geraldine Hunt was to meet a man who would change the direction of Freedie's young life. Known Montreal producer Tony Green had first signed Freddie's mother to do an album. While she was practicing the material one day at home, Freddie, his sister and grandmother joined in, each doing a different song from Geraldine's repertoire. The songs were taped, and Geraldine brought Freddie's number to Tony Green, who immediately heard the young man's potential. The result: Get Up And Boggie, Freddie's first album on Warner Bros., featuring the smash title track, a disco hit through Canada and the U.S.Photo (Freddie James)","1979",0,0

For the last four years, Robert Walker has known such rewards, the first two as coach of the YMCA Football Little League and the last two as the commissioner of the program.""This program is realy special,"" says Walker. ""It is really special for the kids. For many of them, this is their only chance to do something like this. It is their only chance to travel, to get out of their neighborhoods. It keeps many of them out of trouble. That is what makes this program so special.""There are eight teams in the league which is divided into two groups, the eight, nine and ten-year-olds and the 11, 12 and 13-year-olds. There are 200 kids participating in the Winston-Salem program, 25 on each team. Like the professional teams that the kids dream about playing on, the league begins in September and ends in January with a Super Bowl of their own. ""Last year, we played a 'Y' team from Florida,"" says Walker, who spends most of his non-RJR Archer, Inc. hours working on making the program something the kids will treasure no matter how much they play.As an example of his extra effort, Walker has made arrangements for the teams to travel to places like Washington, D.C., Lynchburg, Va., and Richmond, Va., for contests.

A $50,000 grant from the city of Oakland will enable Jenkins to get out even more so in the community and recruit young women.""Our motto is girls of today and women of tomorrow,"" said Jenkins. ""We're now in the process of beginning a female adolescent project and we are hoping to get young ladies from the police department and the probation office,"" she added.Jenkins has apparently come a long way since efforts in getting community response to her organization began. After two years of trying to get participation from the churches in East Oakland, she almost gave up, until St. Louis Bertrand Catholic Church responded.""I had talked earlier with J. Alfred Smith, pastor of the Allen Temple Baptist Church and he told me that his church had everything to offer young girls in their community,"" said Jenkins. ""He did give me the name of a woman who was over the youth there, but she never contacted me. I was hoping that the Allen Temple youth and EOGA's youth could get together at times, but it didn't work out that way.""Jenkins also said that she has yet to hear from the businesses in her Elmhurst district and other commucity organizations.Another problem has been the see-sawing attendance rate of EOGA. Jenkins' staff is down to three, including herself, and although the organization is open to all girls from 9 to 18 years, they admit to having difficulty in keeping the older teenagers.""Most of the girls who participate in the program are between the ages of 10 and 12,"" she said. ""However by the time some of the girls reach age 14, they feel they have outgrown us.""Many of the older teenagers disliked being around the younger girls, said Patricia Coutee, staff member who joined in 1975.""Also, many of them became involved in high school activities and they just didn't have the time, some even went on to college.""These young ladies still drop in from time to time, Jenkins added, and some have a hard time leaving when they reach the limited age.A grant writing proposal class that Jenkins attended produced negative affects. ""In the class we were taught to ask prospective members for donations ranging from $25 to $1000 dollars,"" she said. ""So our new membership applications has requests for those amounts and we haven't received a penny since the beginning of this year.""Members, occasionally would donate $5 and $10 but, so far, they haven't sent us anything.""Jenkins said she'll continue to use her new membership application.Linda Beal, another staff member, also added that the organization has suffered attendance-wise because of an image put on it by the girls themselves.""A lot of girls, when you approach them about the program, think it's a place for bad girls,"" said Beal. ""They think it's a place for juvenile delinquents or something.""Beal, who holds a degree in Psychology, from the Holy Names College in Oakland, said she is glad to be in an area where she can use her skill and knowledge.Coutee hopes to finish her work in Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley so she can devote more time to the project also.Despite some pitfalls the organization has faced, its goals and objectives have remained the same.""We are trying to promote a positive self-image, to reverse the trends of destructive behavior, incomplete education and premature motherhood,"" said Jenkins. ""We also intend to develop leadership and survival skills through personal and family counseling, tutoring, career development, health and family life education, arts crafts, homemaking, consumer education, sports and recreational programs.""By offering the girls these options,"" she continued, we can help insure a stable way of living in today's society that will enable them to function as independent women of tomorrow.""The program operates after school hours from 3 to 6 p.m. in the church's schoolyard on 100th avenue and East 14th streets in Oakland.Currently, the association has 175 paid memberships and girls of all races, religions or ethnic backgrouns are welcome.Jenkins also is very proud of past awards the EOGA's cheerleading squad has won.""We have participated in the St. Patrick's Day Parade, the Labor Day Parade; we have had Christmas Bazaars, hosted the Mayor's Prayer Breakfast which we will be doing against this year.""Among other activities, the EOGA has made visits to convalescent homes, have given thanksgiving boxes to the needy and hosted social events for the community, including fashion shows, dances, skating, swimming, and pajama parties.General members also enjoy free tickets to concerts, plays, cultural events and operas.Eventually when the EOGA stabilizes itself, Jenkins, Beal and Coutee hope to move on within their fields of expertise.""I'd like to organize other girls organizations,"" said Jenkins. ""Someone has suggested I start a group in North Oakland. I'm willing but all I need is a place and someone that will be committed to that area.""Coutee and Beal said that they would like to branch off into some other community service organization.Photo (COOKING IT UP: Students at St. Louis Bertrand School work together in the kitchen to cook up a meal.)","1979",1,0

In short, he looked a mess.""I don't remember a whole heck of a lot about the experience itself, except that I wanted to communicate with my nurse.

I wanted to talk and I couldn't.""But at any rate, none of us had any experience with this kind of stuff before. We were all pretty scared, so we all individually (we found out later) went to the doctors and told them about it. Well, they told me that there was nothing wrong with me, that I might feel a little groggy for a couple of days until the drug got completely out of my system -- my system got back accustomed to being normal again. But the doctors said there was really nothing to worry about -- fine.""A bunch of us got together -- the twelve of us -- and we started talking to each other in a group, saying, Hey, I said this to the doctor and he told me there was nothing wrong, and the other guy said, 'Well, I said the same thing and he told me nothing was wrong, and What's wrong with you?'

The center was repeatedly accused by the Social Services Union of bad-faith bargaining, but investigations by United Way of Alameda County and the County Counsel's Office failed to substantiate the charges.Evon Peshon, president of the board of directors, told the supervisors that the center made the rehiring proposals to the union at the suggestion of supervisors Valerie Raymond and Charles Santana.Peshon said that the union had not yet accepted the proposal but that a meeting with union representatives was scheduled for today.She also indicated that the center hoped to hire the strikers as soon as possible.This touched off a lenghty discussion among supervisors Santana, John George and Fred Cooper over whether the center was bargaining in good faith.Cooper's position was that the only question the supervisors should be deciding on was whether the center was doing its share of the bargaining.Santana and George argued in favor of forcing the center to lower the rehiring time commitment from 90 days to 45 or 30 days. They failed to win their point and both voted against continuing funding for the center.Included in the motion for funding was a provision that the county observer, Deputy Kounty Counsel Doug Hickling, continue to monitor the bargaining meetings and report back to the supervisors on the progress.Following the board's decision, Jesse Bean, a striking employee who is a group counselor at the center, said that he felt there would be a period of adjustment as the strikers went back to work.He said he expected ""things will be a little rough at first. We must adjust our feelings and not involve the children.""Ralph B. Hoyt, attorney for the center said that a condition of the rehiring proposal is that there be absolutely no use of the children ""as a vehicle"" by either management or the union.""If this does happen on the part of the staff, they will be subject to disciplinary action.

The amount allocated to each school is based on the reduction of property damage. The awards can be used by the students for any education expenditure such as new materials or athletic equipment, explained Superintendent of Oakland Schools Ruth B. Love.Glenview Elementary School, which in 1976-77 noted vandalism costs at $2,943, reduced damage to $2,071 last school year for a cash award of $1,470.Erika Lee and Jaime Hichcock, both Glenview students, said a disco dance session during lunch period on Fridays as well as a suggestion box contributed to last year's decline in vandalism at their school.The disco, they added, is only offered when students are well behaved.At Roosevelt Jr. High, reduced vandalism was due to student cooperation and teamwork. ""Student leaders met at their roundtable (student council) and discussed ways to reduce vandalism then told student,"" said Margaret Sierra. As a help to other schools in the fight against property damage, students there wrote letters to district administrators detailing how students can be kept from writing on the walls.As a result, Roosevelt's costs, figured in 1976-77 at $12,640, dropped to $6,554 for a cash award of $3,408. The award will be spent on athletic equipment, Sierra said.Tarsha Jordan, a Carter Junior High student who impressed those present with her poise and eloquence, noted incoming 7th graders attending orientation sessions ""are told the do's and don'ts.""""Then bulletins are sent out at 2nd and 5th period each day reminding students to take care of school property,"" she said.The communication has apparently paid off. Vandalism to property valued at $4,210 during 1976-77 was reduced to $3,674, a decrease of 87 percent, for an award of $3,196.One student from Frick Junior High school disputed a newspaper report detailing a high rate of vandalism. The student, Arlene Mayberry, said various activities such as a book club, along with hall patrols had contributed to reduced andalism.""Hall patrols don't give the students time to break windows,"" she said.Clyde McGregor, also a Frick student added that students helped paint murals on walls. For the year 1976-77 vandalism costs of $11,918 dropped to $8,217 for a reduction of $3,701 last year.In addition to offering cash incentives to schools with decreased vandalism, the district, Love said, is encouraging the community to report instances of vandalism which usually occur during weekends when the district has less security control.Most of the students agreed there might be a correlation between vandalism and truancy. Frick student Arlene Mayberry pointed out that many truant students get even with teachers by vandalizing property. ""But now students are starting to get down on other students who vandalize property,"" she said.However, most disagreed with one reporter's point that there might be a parallel in vandalism involving new schools. In addition, Supt. Love said there's no higher incidence of vandalism in Oakland's flatlands than in the hill area.","1979",0,1
"840","Jordan, Vernon E, Jr",1979-06-12,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","The nation still refuses to confront the crucial issue of mounting unemployment, especially among blacks and young people.Experts are still talking about a slowdown this year, perhaps ever a full-scale recession. But few seem concerned that even as we're supposed to be wallowing in prosperity nearly six million people are officially counted as jobless.And if you count the discouraged workers who have given up hope of finding work, involuntary part-time workers, and new entrants into the labor force, the ranks of the jobless almost double.Black unemployment remains extraordinarily high--well over double the white rate. Official national unemployment figures mask the full extent of joblessness in many cities and states, and they hid the true impact on blacks.In some big states, black unemployment is triple that for whites. In 1978, fewer than five percent of white workers in Illinois were unemployed, but about fifteen percent of black workers in the state were jobless. Six percent of whie Pennsylvanians were out of work in 1978, but . . . black rate was triple that--about eighteen percent.And those are the official, understand unemployment rates. If white workers were unemployed in the numbers black workers are, Congress and the Administration would be falling over themselves to expand job programs and get people back on payrolls.Instead, there is a mix of indifference and comforting statements about how the total number of jobless are shrinking.Racism can't be ignored as a factor in this national indifference. As long as unemployment is concentrated among blacks, America appears to be content to go about its business, cutting federal jobs programs, clamping a lid on food stamp spending, and refusing to implement job and income maintenance programs.And to soothe their consciences, many people simply blame the jobless for their plight. I am constantly bombarded by letters and statements from people who claim there are plenty of jobs available and that blacks are just too lazy to get out there and find work.As proof, many people cite the newspaper want ads. Pages upon pages of job openings listed, even in cities where jobless rates are high.Well, a few months ago Washington Post reporter Martha Hamilton looked at those want ads. She picked a day on which over 1,000 jobs were listed. Observation number one--on that day 77,600 people were unemployed, or over seventy people for each job opening!Of the jobs offered, nearly one out of five could be eliminated immediately. Some were for part-time work, some were come-ons, some required moving out of town, and others required special tools or licenses.Another fifteen percent were for professional managers, a group with very low unemployment levels. Another 22 percent were for skilled craftspeople, again rarely found among the hard core inner city jobless.A quarter of the jobs were for clerical positions. Thanks to inferior educational opportunities and keen competition for skilled office workers, few of those jobs become available to the inner city poor.So what's left? A fourth of the jobs advertised were for unskilled workers. Those jobs are snapped up quickly, with many applicants for each opening. Those so-called ""lazy"" people line up hours before opening time to grab what jobs they can. And for every fortunate person who lands a low-paying, unskilled job, many are turned away.So there goes the argument that plenty of jobs are available, just look at the papers. The fact is that few jobs are available for unskilled, poorly educated workers--the people most in need of jobs.Yes, jobs are available, but there is a mismatch between the job requirements and the skills of the people available for work. Sometimes that mismatch is artificial-employers demand credentials or skills that could be taugh on the job or aren't needed at all. Many jobs today demand high school diplomas or even college diplomas for work that used to be performed by people with only elementary school education.So there are many more people out of work than there are available jobs. And this is no temporary phase, but a permanent feature of our economy.","1979",0,1

Often the reader is left with the impression that apple growers have neglected to perpetuate some fine old varieties. Reasons vary, for example: a number of old favorites were biannnual croppers-i.e., the variety set fruit only every other year! This was fine when apples were grown for home consumption. But for todays commercial orchard operation, with large acreages of fewer varieties, higher costs of production and greater distances to market, each variety has to ""pay its way"" and produce a predictable and marketable crop every year.Some of the old favorites were very tender bruised easily and colored poorly. For modern packaging and shipping needs, and consumer preferences for brightly colored and attractive fruit, flavor alone is not enough. The fruit must also meet am demanding consumer needs for high quality color and flavor.Many old varieties have transferred their legacy on to new varieties. The Cortland apple, for instance is a cross of the old Ben Davis and the McIntosh; Idared variety has the Wagner and Jonathan varieties for parentage. The Jonathan while discovered by chance, is believed to have had the Esopus Spitzenberg as one illustrious parent. Similarly, one parent of the Stayman variety is believed to have been the Winesap, and one parent of Golden Delicious was probably Grimes Golden.Plant breeders who work to develop new apple varieties and select for specific characteristics maintain many of the old varieties in research orchards for use in cross breeding for new variety development.","1979",0,0

Presidential aids are put in an awkward position of hacking needed health, education and welfare projects out of the 1980 fiscal budget.Buying more military hardware than the current 31 Posidon submarines is suspect to sophisticated budget watchers. These nuclear submarines are capable of sustaining damage to more than 2000 Soviet cities. Experts point out that each of the nation's Poseidon submarines carries 16 missiles and each missile can carry up to 14 warheads, everyone of them twice as powerful as the kiloton bomb (equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT) that devastated Hiroshima:General Alexander M. Haig, Jr., supreme allied commander, Europe, speaking to a capacity crowd at the Shearton Palace Hotel luncheon of the Commonwealth Club of California, stated that the U.S. is ""still vastly superior in military and economic assets"" over the Soviet Union. General Haig is concerned, as is President Carter, in maintaining this position. While the present occupant of the White House, got a three percent real growth in the defense budget this fiscal year, Genral Haig wants to get a three percent increase for the next six years. Such devotion to duty seems to be done only in the case of defense spending.Deploying more of the nation's resources for defense does little for the poor and unemployed people. Black American unemployment continues to climb without White House notice. General Haig, having officially resigned his position, is having a good time practicing being President on the podium. Presidents who put bullets before people are bound to wake up one day and find the foundation of their country has collapsed. The total cost of U.S. weapons programs leaped by nearly $22.5 billion late last yar. The addition of one more nuclear powered attack submarine alone was responsibile for almost $1.2 billion hoos in the U.S. Navy program. President Carter's new CETA programs put only one-third this amount over a period for four years to look for jobs in industry for those Americans who are very poor and long-term unemployed. People must become a priority with the President and those who would be President, from the white of Black American perspective. Posidon submarines are augmented with 30 other submarines, 376 bombers and 1054 land based missiles, carrying a total of 92000 warheads. When we have decided to place the same over kill instincts on integrating all of our citizens into out business and social life, then we will far surpass the soviets in defense of thos or any other country.","1979",0,1
"843","Magnani, Peter",1979-05-10,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","The needs of people don't win out over the dictates of the economic balance sheet very often these days, but they did recently in the case of John Adams Community College Center, which operates an adult high school program on Hayes and Masonic street in San Francisco.A suggestion to move the program to the Alemany Center in the Tenderloin emerged during an administrative brainstorming session on how to cope with post-Proposition 13 budget restraints. But the idea was vetoed in deference to concerns voiced by students, teachers and community residents.""It was one of many suggestions, that came in"", Laurent Broussal, acting president of the City's Community College Centers division told the Sun Reporter. ""Fiscally it makes good sense, but it never reached the status of an actual recommendation,"" Broussal said, because so many of the people involved in the program opposed it.But the ""suggestion"" hit the John Adams community too close for comfort. The school's Faculty Council unanimously adopted a resolution strongly opposing the move and citing about a dozen reasons for their disapproval. The teachers' union adopted a nearly unanimous resolution. And hastily formed ""Save John Adams Emergency Student Commitee"" organized a protest assembly at the school which was attended by hundreds of teachers, students and activists from the neighboring Haight-Ashbury community.Broussal, who attended the meeting and assured those present that the high school program was not going to move, said he was vexed that so much noise was being made about a plan that he claimed the protestors already knew had been scrapped. But some people said they didn't trust the district administration. They noted that plans had been made to move the high school program two years ago and pointed out that pressure from the community was instrumental in stopping the move at that time.Oddly, the community college facility at 750 Eddy St. Where the high school program was to have gone, is the same building that housed it when it was first established, 14 years ago. The program was moved to John Adams, the site of the old Lowell High School, because the Eddy Street facility was judged to be inadequate.John Adams has much more classroom space, plus room for a library, science labs, child care center, cafeteria, auditorium and other amenities that did not exist on Eddy Street. The extra space has made it possible for the school to gain state accreditation and to add elective courses that offer a variety to high school students, as well as attracting other students, who are not enrolled in the high school program.Neighborhood residents made it clear at the protest meeting that they regard John Adams as a valuable community facility and consider plans to move the high school program to be a threat to their neighborhood.In addition, the spectre of covert racism raised its ugly head, in the form of suggestions by students and some faculty members that the chronic overtures about moving the high school program are the result of attempts by the district's administration to get rid of John Adams's director, Maxwell Gillette. Gillette is the only Black director among eight community college centers throughout the city.Broussal said he does not know of any attempt to undermine Gillette.Broussal said the John Adams center is ""underutilized"" at present, according to the districts cost-efficiency standards. But he vowed that the problem would be solved by adding programs to John Adams, rather than by relocating the high school program elsewhere.Originally the suggestion had been move the English as a Second Language (ESL) classes currently being taught at Alemany, over to John Adams and to add them to the ESL courses that are offered there now. The high school program would then occupy the Alemany site.In addition to the other problems with that plan, students complained that it would result in racially segregated facilities, where the central location of John Adams, plus the existence of electives and some ESL classes and special programs such as nursing result in the center being integrated at persent.Broussal said he would be bringing some money-saving suggestions about reorganizing the community college centers to the district's board of directors on May 22. But he promised that the removal of the high school program from John Adams would not be one of them.","1979",0,1

Among those in attendance were Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hampton of San Francisco, Mr. and Mrs. Jeffrey Hunter he's General Manager of the Oakland Ballet and Ms. Shirley Melton accompanied by George Hill. Alameda County Supervisor John George was in attendance for the concert earlier.Dimensions Advisory Board put on the reception. The Board includes co-chairpersons Ms. Gall Berkley, Managing Editor of the Post Newspaper Group, and Tim Marshall- Djenaba Blair and Yvonne Murphy-Wesley . . . DID YOU EXERCISE YOUR PRECIOUS RIGHT TO VOTE?The simple truth expressed herein, with no malice aforethought, is that Afro-Americans can attain ""The good life"" only by fully accepting the responsibilities of our great Democracy, as productive citizens. Our most valuable asset is the RIGHT AND DUTY to vote for the persons we feel are most qualified to hold local or national offices.OUR forefathers paid an enormous price for us to enjoy the blessings they were systematically denied. The blessings of FREEDOM are NOT free. We must be totally involved with ALL Americans in the protection and furtherance of the American way of life, especially for the future of our children. Therefore, your privilege to vote is as much a DUTY as a privilege. Local, state, and national elections become more serious with each passing day. Be aware of these truths and protect OUR rights to life, liberty and happiness, by voting in EVERY election.Our community, like so many others, has a special need for a certain type of service to be provided by Foster Homes. We are all aware of the valuable services rendered by these dedicated people. However, there is an acute need for special attention to youngsters whose natural parents, (Or one of the latter), are severely unstable, and in need of psychiatric help.These particular children do not really have a ""Childhood"" because they are performing a ""Role reversal"" in the family when the little girl, or boy, must provide the emotional support of the mother or father. These youngsters need strong foster parents who can respond to their needs as youngsters in transition during adolescence. They need foster parents who are good role models, capable of weathering the adolescence identity crisis, and still be very loving and supportive. The raising of teenagers is never easy, and these particular children offer a greater challenge than most. Progress will be slow, but the reward is provided by successfully meeting the challenge, as we watch the youngsters improve emotionally and scholastically.Information relevant to become a Foster parent is available by calling the Alameda County Social Services Agency, 874-6911.Ms. Barbara Jordan, the first Black lady in her State (Texas) Senate, and first Black Congress-lady from the deep South, is now the Lyndon B. Johnson Public Service Professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, the University of Texas. She has been named one of eleven ""Women of the Decade,"" by the Ladies Home Journal. These eleven were chosen after ten thousand Journal readers (Polled) chose from fifty-two women, cited as ""Women of the Year,"" in the magazine, from 1973 through 1978. Professor Jordan was among eight persons selected as ""Women of the Year,"" in 1975. She and the other ""Women of the Decade"" will be the Honorees (by the Journal), at a dinner in New York City, Nov. 28th. One paragraph from the Journal's summary on Professor Jordan, reads-""So strong and articulate has been her advocacy that she remains a force, even though out of the mainstream of public life. Now, Lyndon B. Johnson Public Service Professor at Texas University, she teaches others to use power to effect changes within the political systemfor the good of all."" Professor Jordan has received Twenty-five Honorary degrees. We respectfully off a salute and a deep bow to Lady Barbara Jordan!","1979",0,0

Art alone enduring stays to us. Because you deal sensitively and realistically with the complexities of the human condition, your work will doubtless endure to be appreciated by future generations. I commend your dedication to artistic excelle2ce and your willingness to give of your time and talents to help the less fortunate."" Lark is very blessed to receive a citation from the highest ranking official in the state of California.However, being cited is not new to him. Lark has received formal acknowledgement from President Jimmy Carter, two previous American presidents, and from over 600 other individuals of importance.""I have always received more praise than I understood or deserved--this probably happens to most people...they are praised for a natural talent they have received as a gift from God..."" said the renowned artist.Today's universal recognition of Afro-American artists and their works was influenced, in part at least, by the promotional policies pursued by Lark. He has given freely of his time. And he does everything he can to support fellow artists in their struggles by urging major art centers to exhibit and buy their works, American and Afro-american artists in particular. He has voluntarily collected, arranged, and coordinated nattional and state-wide exhibitions, introducing to American audiences the art of Afro-American visual artists especially. He has even assisted them with framing, shipping and crating.Not the least of Lark's other significant contributions include doing research and writing. His written reports led to an expansion of the plan so that the history of great American artists would include the whole story, not just that of Caucasian artists, but great Black American artists as well. His writings have extended internationally to books on art, magazines, newspapers, and brochures. He also wrote excellent biographies of American and Afro-American artists.This fusion of great art and scholarship is Lark's life, the culmination of an amazing amount of pride, ability, and dedication.Not only has Lark made things happen for himself and other artists, but he has contributed much to aid and promote the welfare of humanity. He has found time from a busy art career to contribute his time to the aid of an Ex-Felon and Kick Drug Abuse Program. He has also worked with juvenile delinquents. And further, he donated 40 original master prints to the art auction to benefit the Sickle Cell Disease Research Foundation headquartered in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles.Photo","1979",0,0

"847","",1979-03-15,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","A coalition of California public officials, advocacy groups and private citizens has launched a head-on attack on the problems facing minorities since the passage of Proposition 13.The diverse group met recently at UC-Berkeley in a statewide conference sponsored by the Bay Area Urban League, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), Oakland Citizens' Committee for Urban Renewal (OCCUR) and the University of California Policy Implementation Project, Institute of Governmental Affairs.The conditions decried by conference attendees included:--the ""massive shift"" of resources from the public to the private sector;--the sharp decline in business tax revenues and equally sharp increase in individual tax burdens;--the economic squeeze being placed on public employees;--the centralization of power in Sacramento and Washington;--the popular belief that economic efficiency means cutting programs, not bureaucracies;--the conflicting regulations among federal, state and local funding agencies;--the added burdens upon the poor, versus the economic windfalls for the corporate sector;--the failure of the business sector to reinvest Proposition 13 savings into the community;--the vast number of public employees who live outside of the communities that pay their salaries;--the still-unaddressed issue of inflation facing post-Proposition 13 California;--the watering-down of Affirmative Action programs;--the postponement of solutions through the use of surplus ""bail-out"" funds.Conference participants passed a resolution calling for Governor Brown ""to place his highest priority on meeting the needs of Californians, devoting full attention to problems of the state.""The resolution also demanded that courts resist any backsliding on affirmative action and equal protection under the law; that research and communication about minority issues be increased; that the public be informed of the consequences of ""blind anti-government sentiment""; that government agencies conduct public hearings before any cutbacks are made; and that the issues be brought to the Legislature ""as often as necessary.""Paul Cobb, executive director of OCCUR, said Proposition 13 has resulted in $159 million in tax savings in Alameda County--$3 billion in the state as a whole. ""Yet less than 10% of that windfall has been reinvested in the community,"" Cobb said.His strategies include organizing local councils of self-reliance to monitor governmental spending continually and to establish local employment, economic and social impact statements on each government project; creating community-owned business ventures establishing public land trusts and a ""green-lining fund"" to re-build inner cities; undertaking real estate development as a public enterprise, such as the Port of Oakland; giving city employment preference to city residents; passing renters' relief ordinances; and giving businesses tax incentives for reinvesting in the community and participating in all of these programs.Such a multi-faceted approach could produce $5 billion in state revenues, create 50,000 jobs, stabilize neighborhoods, develop a sense of community ownership and improve the state's educational quality, Cobb said.""The $3 billion that the corporations throughout the state have reaped from Proposition 13 could go a long way toward replacing the programs your governor has proposed,"" Cobb said. ""I see this as a new opportunity for us to pull together and get money from the private sector, where less strings would be attached to the funds.""The message of Proposition 13 is that nobody is going to give us anything,"" and the first step toward creating ""serious alliances"" where ""ethnic specialty groups"" once existed is to register to vote, Cobb said. ""If we'd voted, we wouldn't even be talking about Proposition 13 today.""Percy Steele of the Bay Area Urban League labeled Proposition 13 ""An anti-minority, anti-poor measure,"" citing the $54 million reduction in welfare budgets in California.

He said the cost of such in cidents was significantly more than BART planners had anticipated.Additionally, fare evasion at television-monitored stations rose significantly, leading to a loss of $93,000 to the district a ""conservative"" estimate according to a BART report.The report also shows that 29 percent of the time riders calling Central Control for assistance did not get responses within two minutes, while such a ""non-response"" would only occur four percent of the time when a station agent was on the scene.Installing the television-monitoring system has cost BART more than $830,000, yeilding a yearly savings of $245,000.

"855","Curtis, Emory",1979-06-28,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","In a manner of speaking, cities can be looked upon like women, with the right visual physical assets they are pretty but it takes the right internal workings to make them good.San Francisco has the physical assets that make it one of the striking cities of the world, the hills and the extensive waterfront. San Francisco is a downright pretty city. There are few places that can make that claim stick.Also, when it comes to municipal services, the workings that make a city good, San Francisco has one asset that is not duplicated by any city west of Chicago, that's Muni, a public transportation system that actually takes you from one place to another in the city.Muni is run by a brother, Curtis Green, who has been in the drivers seat for over five years. During that period Muni has undergone, and is undergoing, more changes for the better than it has since the Municipal and Market Street Railways were combined in 1944.When Curtis took over, the Muni had 333 old trolley coaches and now they have all been replaced by 345 new trolley coaches, 100 new motor coaches have been put into service.New service facilities have been built; the street cars are being replaced with modern Light Rail Vehicles (LRV), and Muni will soon be operating in a subway under Market Street.Also, Muni lines are being changed to improve cross-town and community services. The new changes will allow one to get to many crosstown destinations as easy as it is to get downtown on Muni.This changing from the old system and the old way of doing things to the new has met opposition and created heat; and the brother has caught that heat and kept moving on.In the Bayview area, Curtis instituted a community service line, 54 Williams, that serves the community and allows Bayview/Hunters Point residents to catch the bus for trips within the community, including going to the supermarkets.The 82 Chinatown line was added to provide better service to the Chinatown area where there are a lot of people who have to use the bus because of lack of money.If you can remember, just a few years ago there often were media reports on the poor maintenance and breakdowns of Muni equipment; you don't see those reports anymore now.When Curtis Green took over Muni he took on the problems that had been piled up by the previous management. There were years of accumulated maintenance neglect; as a result the breaking down of equipment before it went into service and in service was a regular recurring experience for Muni riders and workers alike. That problem is being solved.The amazing thing to me about Curtis Green's performance as general manager of Muni is that it is being done with one hand tied behind his back.The general manager only has maintenance, operation, and planning under his wing. Public relations, personnel, engineering and construction, and finance are all under the PUC Bureaus.As a result, Curtis has to be both a manager and politician.And he can do it. He knows Muni inside and out; he started with Muni as street car operator years ago, and now he runs the system.Curtis Green is a public servant who actually believes in delivering services to the public. He looks upon the general managers job as the leader of a cause, not just a gig. The city needs more public servants like Curtis Green.","1979",0,0

Last month, the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates in an attempt to limit credit excesses. With prime interest rates at major banks at 15 percent, the housing problem appears to be devastating.Money is still available for home buyers willing to pay those rates, but not everyone can afford it. Mortgage companies are laying off workers and sharply reducing their costs. Housing experts are now saying there will be a 25 percent decrease in housing starting next year.Meanwhile, unemployment is still expected to climb. Fiscal conservatives are saying high unemployment is the price this country must pay in the war against inflation. And Blacks are saying this is unacceptable. And it is.Black America cannot afford to subscribe to the trade off theory...that high unemployment decreases inflation...and that high employment increases the risk of overinflating an economy.The problems of housing and employment will loom even larger as a concern as inflation soars and a recession deepens. Housing and jobs are basic needs. A solution must be found.","1979",0,1
"857","Strickland, Ida B",1979-05-24,"Sun Reporter (1968-1979)","A friend is one who can be called upon for help or assistance, who can be counted on during the good and bad times, someone to share your insecurities and fears and someone to whom you can boast and brag when you feel you've done a good job. A friend and only a friend can gently bring you down to Earth when you get too far out. I found such a friend in Bob Covington.I can't quite remember when or through whom I met the man, but from the first meeting we developed an instant admiration for each other. As friends often do, we sometimes defended each other from people who either felt Bob was too abrasive or aggressive (a description used for a Black man ""who won't take no shit""), or I was too independent, or whatever. We knew each others personality traits and were sensitive to the others problems. Therefore, I find it hard to accept Bob's death as a suicide. Financial problems were alluded to as one possible reason, but financial problems and pressures are a daily fact of life for most Black people.I last saw Bob in mid-March when he dropped in after returning from a trip to Ohio before going back to Seattle. We talked for several hours over a bottle of wine and spaghetti about his daughter who had just entered college, about the San Francisco political scene, about his real estate ventures in Seattle and a major conference he had been planning. He was extremely excited about the possibilities of the conference that would have brought together the Black Church and Black political leadership to develop a cohesive Black Agenda. He had a possibility of getting a grant from the Episcopal Diocese and was seeking additional matching funds.Our next contact was by telephone less than a week before his death, ""Hey, Lady, I need some help"", was the plea. It was one I had heard several times before and again I responded that I would see what I could do. He was happy to learn that I would be in Seattle within a week and we made arrangements to meet and set up some other appointments in Seattle. He was definitely not depressed, nor suicidal.The message that my friend, Bob Covington, had died awaited me at the hotel registration desk when I arrived on Tuesday morning.I was later to learn that while he had indeed taken some barbituates, he had also been experiencing severe chest and arm pains. Unfortunately, Bob was not one who would admit to any physical limitations and it is conceivable that he may have taken barbituates to relieve the pain and disregard the body's warning signals.Beyond his work at WAPAC and District Elections, Bob was everywhere, at a hundred meetings, conferences, politicans' offices, speaking out against racism and keeping the Black Agenda first and foremost at the top of every piece of legislation and every community issue. He chided us to never allow San Francisco's liberals and so-called progressives to speak for Black people.Many of the ""powers that be"" of this City feared Bob Covington, which explains why such a bright, capable, respected, Black leader could not get a single job offer in San Francisco. They also knew that Bob mentally never left San Francisco and always planned to return some day.Bob left a lovely wife and four beautiful children. A trust fund for the Covington children is being established. For information on the Trust Fund, call 543-0890.","1979",0,0

They were selected from both the Old and New Testaments.With this lesson we begin a unit entitled ""Christ Provides Redemption,"" using only New Testament material by Paul and John. We will look at what it means to become a new person in Christ, how Christians must grow, and the hope they have in this life and the next.I. FREE FROM SIN AND DEATH [Rom. 8:1-4].Being free from sin and death does not mean we will not encounter sin, but the moment we accepted Christ as our personal Savior He took our sin from us, and there is nothing we can do to merit this gift; through the redemption of Christ and the guidance of His Spirit, we are protected day by day. Therefore, we have become citizens of two worlds, and the struggle goes on, sin against the Spirit. But, if we can trust in Christ, He will continue to keep us from sin.II. RAISED TO NEW LIFE [Eph. 2:1-6].Through the blood of Jesus Christ we have been raised from that old Adamic nature to the living life of Christ. We are now children of obedience. In times past we walked according to the course of this world, fulfilling the desires of the flesh. But God is rich in mercy, because of His great love, and we who were dead in sins were brought to life with Christ.III. SAVED BY GRACE FOR GOOD WORKS [Eph. 2:7-10].God's ""Kindness toward us through Christ Jesus"" has been and will continue to be demonstrated with ""all the immeasurable riches of His grace."" By His grace we are saved, and not of ourselves, lest any man should boast. It is the gift of God.","1979",0,0

Nothing seems to slow the pace or the excitement that this area has to offer. Nor does anything seem to stop the steady flow of adventurers coming to take in that excitement. In fact, I don't believe that anything could stop that same steady flow except, well, maybe if our boys in Washington get us into some nuclear confrontation. Remember the M.X. Missile program which seems almost certain to become a reality? it's right smack dab in Northern Nevada. However, I don't think we have to worry about that happening soon.Last week we visited the North Shore of Lake Tahoe so why not come with me this week to the other end, the South Shore. Unlike the North Shore, the pace is a bit faster, the entertainment Headliners, but like it's opposite end, it's just as beautiful.There are four gigantic casinos in Stateline, three of which are hotels as well. The fourth one has been the cause of controversy and bitter debate between Nevada and California for several long years (most of which stemmed from environmental concerns).

The hotel is not open due to construction, but everything else is coming along as Caesars execs descended upon the place with true Caesars World vitor.

Alternating with B.B. is Fredric Apcar's ""Bedazzle."" Aptly named, this revue is excellently choreographed, magnificent costumed and with it all comes Sammy King (no relation to B.B.). This comedian ventriloquist is definitely a high point in the show.When it comes to food, Harrah's is the only place that one can be served fresh, yes fresh lobster and Bluepoint oysters daily. Harrah's has worked hard. It's one of only eight hotels in the nation to be awarded the five star award by Mobile Travel uides as well as the AAA Five Diamond Award. (800) - 648-3773.Directly across the street is Harvey's Resort Hotel. Beautifully decorated Harvey's has always been my favorite. It's grace and charm has always made me feel comfortable. It features continuous entertainment in high season from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. That's 18 hours of continuous live alternating shows. Currently appearing is ""Garlin Gatherring,"" ""Crossroads"" and Mr. Piano, himself ""Big Tiny"" Little. Harvey's is also another hotel that is well known for it's foodfare with five restaurants to serve you. Including probably the best buffet in South Shore. And for the gourmet, step inside the glass elevator ride it to the top and enjoy an exotic cocktail in the Tiki lounge. Then step into the restaurant for a delicious dinner with a spectacular view.

Robert Vifian, chef-owner of Tan Dinh, one of Paris' many Vietnamese restaurants, pickled cranberries to serve with king crab rolls. Vifian said the deep-fried rolls in papery rice pancakes are ""a very traditional, very classical Vietnamese dish.""He also candied cranberries to garnish creme de coco, or coconut pudding, and uses cranberry juice cocktail and canned whole berry sauce to make sweet and sour pork.The 32-year-old Vietnamese, who took a degree in English at Paris' Sorbonne University, said cranberries fit neatly into Vietnamese cooking because, ""We insist on having a red touch in dishes. It can be cranberries or carrots. Red is supposed to bring good luck.

"868","",1980-11-27,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","By the time you get through paying for Christmas catalogs this year, you may be too broke to buy presents.Of the 67 listed in one fashion magazine's annual Christmas catalog guide, only nine are free. The others range in price from $1 to $40 and you'd have to shell out $273.40 for all 58.Publication costs today can run into the millions -- which accounts for the charges being made by more and more retailers. A catalog is apt to be free to active charge customers and selected mailing lists, but $1 or more to everyone else.Bloomingdale's price is $3, says Gordon Cooke, the store's senior vice president for sales promotion, ""to discourage people who just collect catalogs."" Cooke estimated production costs for this year's one million (104-page) catalogs at $1 to $2 million, partly because about 30 percent of its photographs were shot in China.Even a refund with your first order is no longer routine.Gucci's Fifth Avenue shop in New York City sends an $8 gift certificate with its $8 Christmas catalog of high fashion merchandise but limits the certificate's use to purchases of $50 or more.A famous Dallas-based company now sends catalogs free only to active charge account customers, whom mail order director Ron Foppen defines as ""someone who has bought merchandise in the past 18 months."" All other NeimanMarcus customers pay a nonrefundable $2.Town & Country magazine's catalog listings include at least two that are not the sort you order from. The $40 publication and one for $24.95 describe and picture only articles that have already been sold by Christie's and Sotheby's auction galleries around the world in the course of the past year. The articles range from Old Master paintings to pre-Columbian pottery.Christmas catalog shopping has come a long way since Aaron Montgomery Ward opened his first mail order store in Chicago with a small shipping room on North Clark St. and a one-page price list.One of Ward's early lists contained 163 items mostly priced at $1. Among the $1 articles were Kentucky jeans, lace curtains and 12 yards of printed dress fabric.This Christmas some of the most expensive gifts are:--A $220,000 helicopter fitted out as an airborne recreational vehicle for six persons.--A $150,000 walnut pipe cabinet -- 366 pipes and leather attache case included;--An $8,000 Premier Colt six shooter;--A weekend for 100 at a Texas ranch for $60,000;--$50,000 will buy a musical production of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" staged on the recipient's lawn with live performers, including the 12 lords aleaping and the partridge in a pear tree.For somewhat less, say $25 and up, you can order a goldplated tooth to wear on a chain or display as an object d'art -- from The Tooth Fairy catalog, of course. Its publishers are Gladys and William Dear, retired motelrestaurant operators from Rock Island, Ill., who now live in the St. Petersburg, Fla. area.""We didn't want to retire,"" Mrs. Doak said. ""We wanted something we could do at home.""She said they hit upon the tooth idea because she regretted not having saved the baby teeth of their two sons, now grown.Customers can supply teeth themselves for plating, or buy readymades. The brochure is 50 cents, the minimum order, $25. Prices for gold-plated chompers follow the gold market.The Tooth Fairy is among about 375 entrepreneurs whose product and service companies are listed in ""The Unusual-by Mail Catalog,"" by The Print Project (St. Martin's $14.95 hardcover, $5.95 paper.Other extraordinary products from catalog merchants listed in the book include clocks that run backward, loggers' ear plugs, cricket cage glue and Gabby Tabs for people who haven't time to talk to their houseplants.Gabby Tabs release low levels of carbon dioxide as people do when they lean over plants to talk to them.Mail order shopping generally was an $87 billion dollar a year retail business in 1978, the most recent year for which sales figures are available.Most of that money is spent for Christmas gifts, says Donna Sweeney of the Direct. Mail Marketing Association.""Well over 50 percent is conservative,"" Ms. Sweeney said. ""I've even heard that most do about 70 percent of their business between October and January.""The 8,000-member trade association she represents includes any company that sells by mail order. Some sell directly to consumers but have no catalog. Some are catalog stores only. Others are retailers with regular stores and catalogs.Ms. Sweeney said the start of the boom in catalog shopping was in the late 1960s. She thinks large numbers of women entering or re-entering the workforce ""are the most significant factor in the increase.""I think the gas shortage has contributed to it in the past year,"" she said.She said the most popular products with mail order shoppers probably are any kind of general merchandise. including home gadgets and housewares; magazine subscriptions and clothing, followed by books, sporting goods and crafts.She estimated 4,000-5,000 of the association's members publish general and-or special interest catalogs. Many are free. Others sell for 25 cents and up.The tradition of offbeat, outrageously expensive Christmas gifts has been widely copied since the Dallas store's first offering of his-and hers presents in 1952 a live steer for hubby, a sterling silver roast beef serving cart for his wife. Records of their retail prices were lost when fire destroyed much of the store in 1964. Foppen said.This year's $60,000 ranch weekend which includes a longhorn roundup with real cowboys, is in the catalog of Sakowitz, a Houston-based retailer. The ranch is the Y. O. whose own first Christmas catalog offers the $8,000 six shooters. It is a 60,000 acre spread in Kerr County, Texas, about 130 miles from San Antonio.If that's too dear, consider a one, week fishing trip for six aboard the 81-foot Taurus. It's only $16,000, from Creme de la Creme, a new catalog from Kitty and Jody Krug, two Chicago sisters who, are also road construction company executives. The yacht's amenities include Betavision video with movie tapes, grande or simple cuisine and a local fishing guide, if needed.Bloomingdale's is also in the trip business, with a choice of four ranging in price from $350 to $4,600 or more per person. The first is for a Chinese art tour of New York City, and the other, a guided tour to the People's Republic.The most expensive gifts we located were the $220,000 Sikorsky Helicamper in Sakowitz' catalog and the $150,000 pipe cabinet at Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. shops in eight cities. Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.If beef and seafood have become so expensive you can only afford them for Christmas presents, you'll find frozen steaks and Alaska king crab even in Sears, Roebuck's catalog this year.Spokeswoman Kathy Gucfa said the company has expanded both its high-and low-end food categories and. ""We don't think our selection is totally extravagant.""The five packages offered range from just under $33 to about $90 each. Comparable deals from the Omaha packer supplying Sears tend to be $2-$3 less.Yes. Virginia, there are still big spenders.Foppen said his store, with one exception, has always old ""at least one set"" of his andhers gifts. . . . ""The only bomb was an exact replica of Noah's Ark for $600,000,"" he said. It would have had a Texas A&M College veterinarian aboard to tend the animals.""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" production is offered by the Pepperidge Farm Mail Order Co. Inc. of Clinton, Conn.A customer doesn't have to buy the whole package, said company president Robert L. Schmalz. ""You can have your pick of one day or all of them.""""I haven't the foggiest idea,"" he added, of the price for fewer than 12 days. ""It would depend on which day and where the customer lives.""The most ourtageous catalog we located is . . . House."" whose cover correctly proclaims it. ""The Ultimate in Bad Taste!""This $3.95 paperback parody of mail order catalogs was written by Adrienne Marcus, William Dickey and Wayne Johnson and published by St. Martin's.Its ""merchandise"" ranges from the funny and-or silly -- ""attack hamsters"" and ""historic Girl Scout cookies"" mounted on plaques, for instance -- to some really disgustingly sick jokes.Photo (Yes you can still buy gifts for less than $5 by mail.

"871","",1980-02-26,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","If there are several different eating patterns in your family, take a cue from Mrs. Roger Williams, who juggles, three different meal schedules all day and every day. Her concert pianist husband eats one way, she eats another, and their son eats differently from either parent. Discord? Not at all, for Joy Williams lets everyone eat solo all day, then harmonizes the differences at a well-balanced dinner shared by all.Like most professional entertainers, Mr. Williams' day, begins late in the morning but he manages to eat four times before bedtime. Several hours after a substantial breakfast it's a glass of fresh orange juice. Then a sandwich lunch in the early afternoon, and nothing more 'til dinner.Dinner, by the way, comes as no surprise to Roger Williams. He likes to have the dinner menu in the morning and doesn't want any changes. That's the key to Joy's successful arrangement; everyone knows what's coming for dinner and eats accordingly.Joy Williams gets up early but only eats three times a day. She starts off with hot cereal and fruit for breakfast, then egg salad or cottage cheese for lunch with perhaps slivers of raw vegetables.Fourteen-year-old Jim Williams, the youngest of three children and the only one still at home, often eats five times a day. Breakfast is a high protein drink mixed with milk. At his high school, after a mid-morning nutrition break, he eats a hot tray lunch that may contain fish sticks, spaghetti, green salad, milk, and cake and ice cream for dessert. After school he's ravenous again.Joy wants him to have good nutrition support to keeps favorites such as meatloaf in the refrigerator. Jim may make this into a sandwich or eat it plain, adding raw carrot sticks and celery spread with peanut butter. A glass of milk helps tide him over 'til dinner.The major food opus of the day is dinner, served promptly at six. Casseroles are family favorites, particularly this Zucchini Lasagna, Three kinds of cheese boost the family's calcium intake and Contadina stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce add a bright warm flavor. A big green salad and hot bread complete the main course. For dessert, it's vanilla pudding with fresh fruit.Zucchini Lasagne(Makes 8 cups)3 cups (three 8-ounce cans) Contadina Tomato Sauce1 2/3 cups (14 1/2-ounce can) Contadina Stewed Tomatoes1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon sugar1/4 teaspoon crushed anise seed1 teaspoon Italian seasoning1/8 teaspoon pepper1 pound ground beef3/4 teaspoon seasoned salt5-6 zucchini squash2 cups (8 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese2 cups (1 pint) ricotta cheese3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheeseCombine tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, salt, sugar, anise seed, Italian seasoning and pepper in saucepan, Simmer, uncovered, 25 minutes.

I didn't understand how I could make my life more meaningful.""I had all the things I ever wanted in life, but I was quite bored,"" Fonda recalled.So while thousands of others were already denouncing American involvement in Vietnam, Fonda joined the anti-war movement after viewing a televised protest march at the Pentagon.Fonda said the sight of women walking up to soldiers, blowing kisses at them moved her so that she began studying about Vietnam. ""Before, I couldn't find Vietnam on the map,"" she said.Of her experiences in the anti-war movement Fonda said she learned the importance of working together ""Not just through disco and sex, but coming together to make things work.""After an 11-year-old self proclaimed activist criticized her anti-nuclear stance Fonda defended her position.Taken back by the young man's assertion that the Three Mile Island Nuclear accident was the work of sabotage, Fonda said she and the Campaign for Economic Democracy are against the development of new plants. Both Fonda and Tom Hayden her husband are active in the campaign for Economic Democracy.""Were not among those for an immediate shutdown of nuclear power plants because too many jobs would be lost. The plants existing now should be gradually phased out with other energy alternatives,"" she explained.Fonda called nuclear energy hazardous because of the byproduct of radioactive Krypton gas formed during the process of nuclear fission.Noting the availibility of evidence linking birth defects to nuclear energy hazards Fonda asserted, ""Mankind has no right to tamper with the genetic gene pool.""""The big . . . and the nuclear industry have gotten away with lving about nuclear power for years. It's as big a lie as Vietnam,"" she added.A supporter of Presidential candidate Gov. Edmund G. Brown, Fonda candidly said she was not pleased with the alternatives for Presiddnt-including Jimmy Carter.The Carter administration, she said, was at its best when Andrew Young was appointed Ambassador to the United States and at its worst when the diplomat was forced to resign under fire.""Now Cyrus Vance quits--Carter is on the way to taking us to war. No American blood should be spilled in the Middle East,"" she said.In conclusion Fonda encouraged those in attendance to become active in the Oakland community by joining the campaign for Economic Democracy.""It's very important to improve the scene. This could be a city (Oakland), that employs people living her for a change,"" she pointed out.Photo (JANE FONDA)","1980",0,1

His address has been scheduled at Zellerbach Auditorium on the campus of the University of California in order to accommodate the large audience anticipated for his appearance.In a statement outlining the purpose of the occasion, Dr. Neely D. McCarter, President of Pacific School of Religion, said.""The faculty and friends of Pacific School of Religion are pleased to sponsor the first American appearance of Professor Hans Kung since the Vatican declared him no longer acceptable as a 'Catholic Theologian' because we believe that the confrontation between the Vatican and the theologian Hans Kung may prove to be one of the most momentous events in the Christian Church since Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation.""In light of the fact that Professor Kung holds an honorary degree from Pacific School of Religion and because many Protestants have benefited from reading his books, it seemed appropriate and of special importance to offer him an opportunity to make a public statement in this country concerning his conflict with the Vatican and his hopes for the future. By providing him with this opportunity we believe we can contribute to the ongoing dialogue within the churches concerning authority and orthodoxy.""As Professor of Theology at Tubingen University, Kung occupied a chair governed by agreements with the Catholic Church and the German government which give the Church control over Catholic theology departments at state universities.Kung's book, Infallible? An Inquiry, and other writings have raised questions regarding the dogmas about the infallibility of the Church and papacy. The Swiss-born 51-year-old scholar was ordered removed from his teaching post last December in a decision by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the highest tribunal in the Catholic Church on matters of faith and morals. In a compromise worked out by Tubingen, Kung's chair of theology and the Institute for Ecumenical Studies which he directs have been placed under the authority of the university's Academic Senate rather than the Catholic Theology Department.Kung, who was granted an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree by Pacific School of Religion during its Centennial Celebration in 1966, has campaigned for church reforms for more than a decade. The English translations of his books have gained him a wide following in the United States among Protestants-and Catholics who have lauded his works for their lucid exposition of the Christian faith.His visit to Pacific School of Religion has been underwritten by a special grant from a Bay Area foundation.Photo (Dr. Kung)","1980",0,0

Singe it, pick out any feather ends and remove the legs at the first joint, at the same time withdrawing the sinews. Cut off the neck close to the body, leaving a flap of skin to turn over in the usual way. Lay the bird on a chopping board breast down, and make a cut through the skin right down one side, raising the flesh as cleanly from the bones as possible, being careful not to break through the skin.Disjoint legs and wings from the body, and continue removing the flesh from the carcass until the center of the breastbone is reached. Then, proceed with the other side of the bird in the same way, and lift the carcass out.To bone the legs: take hold of the first bone where it was disjointed from the body and scrape the flesh off it until the next joint is reached. Crack the joint, and remove the first part of the bone. Remove the flesh from the other parts of the bone in the same way, turning the leg inside out. Bone the second leg, and then remove as much of the wingbone as possible, cutting if the lower joint entirely.Spread the bird out on the table--skin side down--and remove any pieces of sinew or gristle.

Saxon last week.""It is difficult, if not impossible to demmonstrate a precise relationship between the Bakke decision and the changes in minority enrollments in the University of California which followed the decision,"" the report said.The Bakke decision, decided upon by the Supreme Court in June 1978, said that while race and ethnicity may be considered for affirmative action purposes in admissions, ""the assignment of a fixed number of places to a minority group is not a necessary means toward that end.""Thursday's Bakke report noted a article published in ""The Chronicle of Higher Education"" in 1979 which concluded that minority admissions actually increased in some graduate and professional schools in that year.The article and Thursday's report both noted that statistical evidence on the effects of the Bakke decision were inconclusive.Factors cited clouding research efforts were changes in economic conditions and the job market for graduates, competition amongst students, and financial aid.Historically, the report said, ""there may be some long-term national trends quite independent of the Bakke decision.""Also, the number of applicants to professional schools in any year are small ""and fluctuations should therefore be viewed cautiously.""While it appears the Bakke case had little effect on the number of minority applicants, the report noted, it did cause the University to change its affirmative action program to insure continued minority enrollment.""The response by the University included reexamination of its affirmative action policy to ensure legal compliance with the Bakke decision; the dissemination of information to prospective students, schools, and the community at large to reassure the University's public of its continuing commitment to student affirmative action; and the development of specific goals and policies and the implementation of programs to overcome the underrepresentation of some minority groups.""Other action included sending letters to parents and prospective students informing them of the University's intent to enforce an affirmative action program and the appointment of a task force to recommend uniform policy for the entire system.Although discussion of Prop. 9's effects on the University system was scheduled for Thursday's meeting, the regents decided to defer it to Friday after Governor Brown's speech Thursday night.In that, speech, Brown warned of adverse effects upon citizens dependent upon government services and those of income less than $40,000 per year. Although he basically opposes the measure, as he did its predecessor Proposition 13, he pledged to carry it out.Brown predicted negative effects on the UC system if Prop. 9, passes adding that he would try to salvage ""one of the finest university systems in the world.""Friday, Saxon, informed the regents he had written students warning of possible fee raises next year.In that letter Saxon said the exact impact of Prop. 9, cuts is unknown but the $750 fee students now pay could be raised to $1350 and 12350 for health scneice students.Saxon said the increased fees would come in the form of tuition, something never before imposed on UC students. He explained that the $750 fee now charged is used for University improvements and that increases will be used to pay instructors.Saxon's move was criticized by many of the regents. Regent John Henning said Saxon was ""using"" the students and warned him that Prop. 9, proponents would simply say ""let them (the students) pay"" and get the measure passed.The UC president contended that the letter was not an overreaction but a necessary ""moral"" act.Regent Wilson Riles, state superintendent of public instruction, said the tuition is unnecessary and that if the state's college and university system, community colleges, and PTA were to join together, they could probably find some means to combat Prop. 9, on the June ballot.Thursday's regents meeting was temporarily interrupted by 19 UC. Berkeley theology students attempting to ""arraign"" the Regents for their alleged ""complicity in the criminal development of nuclear weapons"" at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Almos laboratories and called for a discontinuance of University involvement in nuclear weaponry.Eighty demonstrated at Friday's meeting forcing the Regents to reconvene elsewhere.There were no arrests at either meeting.","1980",0,1

Is there anything I can ever do to make things right wigh God?A: The best thing you can do with your past is to give it to God. If you will repent, tell God you're sorry for what you have done, and really commit your life to Him. He will forgive you and cleanse you of your sin. In the Bible we are told. ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"" (I John 1:9).This is not to suggest that sin is not serious business. Sin is so serious that it called for the suffering and death of the Son of God. But when Jesus went to the cross. He died in your place so you would not have to be punished by death for your sins. His death was so sufficient that He can offer complete forgiveness for every repentant sinner.The only condition under which God witholds forgiveness is when one seeks forgiveness while continuing in sin. Jesus said, ""Come to me...and I will in no wise cast (you) out"" (John 6:37). But He also says, ""Go, and sin no more"" (John 8:11).Truly repent. Accept the forgiveness that Jesus offers. Let Him lead you into a new life. When you've made a fresh start, God will wipe the record clean and remember your sin no more. Make up your mind to do the same. Forget the past except to profit from it. Say as the Apostle Paul did, ""This one thing I do, forgetting those things, which are behind, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13, 14).I believe in every mistake or tragedy there is a seed of equivalent benefit. So ask God to let you benefit from this experience and He will. Ask Him to let you help someone who has been through a similar experience or infacing a similar temptation.I believe our lives are like an Oriental carpet designed by a master craftsman. He creates the pattern and directs the weavers. Sometimes weavers make a mistake, but the skilled designer can work the flaw into the pattern creating an even more beautiful design.Right now I want you to say, ""I give my whole life to God and I trust Him to turn my flawed life into a thing of beauty."" I want you to say this at least once a day until you believe it. And you can believe it. Ask God daily for the necessary power to overcome sin and live for Him Spend time in Bible study and prayer. The time will come when the people you have hurt will recognize the transformation brought about in your life. What a testimony this will be of God's forgiveness and love!","1980",0,0

Imagine a dumb white guy like myself thinking that the only criteria for a fan watching a sporting eveng, was how well the particular athletes played the game, and if the home team won or lost.I thought that times had changed and that color didn't have a damn thing to do with it. Boy am I dumb. I absolutely can not understand some Warrior fans saying, that if the team doesn't get some white players, they, the fans, will not pay to see them play. We heard this when Rick Barry was traded to Houston Since then there are still some that have mouthed the same line.Recently, a guy by the name of Ted Stepien took over as president of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. Mr. Stepien would like his team to be comprised of a roster, with half of the players being white. Now that is all very nice and balanced, but let's face it, there are just so many good white players.The majority of the stars in the NBA are BLACK and that figure is growing all the time. Blacks play basketball better than whites, because it is game that can be played with a minimum of equipment, and unfortunately there are more poor Blacks in this country than whites.Therefore if Mr. Stepien wanted white players, he should have bought into a hockey franchise. Blacks do not excel in this sport, and those who do, have a tough time breaking into the lineups of the NHL clubs.If Stepien prefers fifty percent of his club on the white side, he better be prepared to be satisfied with a loser. You may want perfect balance on your roster but if the best players are Black with small exceptions, you are not going to contend with whites staffing half of the squad.A racist attitude may not apply to Ted Stepien. He may feel that the predominant white population can afford the price of the tickets, more readily than can Blacks, and will better support his team, after all dollars at the game are very important.However as naive as I may be I still can't understand why a true basketball fan would care about the athlete's color. Do the majority of fans accept Blacks in Football and Baseball because the uniforms cover the athlete up? What about the . . . Doesn't that count for anything?I guess in the final anaylysis, a bigot is a bigot first, before he is a fan. It is really too bad that after all these many years since the Emancipation. Proclamation, there are still some that like the old days better. I suppose as long as this world is made up of people it will never change. A suggestion might be that since all teams wear different colored uniforms, they could paint, all the players a matching color to satisfy the bigots that call themselves fans.","1980",0,1

"884","",1980-08-22,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","With constantly escalating fuel prices, and the prices of new compact economy cars ranging from $5,000 to $21,000, many consumers are caught in a dilemma deciding whether or not to buy a new economy car, or to spend a lot more money for fuel for thei old cars. After all, one can buy a great many gallons of gasoline for what it costs to buy a new economy car, even if gasoline prices should increase to $2.00 per gallon or more.The solution for many people could be in buying a used Vega, and investing a few hundred dollars to put it in first class mechanical condition. The Vega was manufactured by Chevrolet from 1971 to 1977, and is one of the only two compact four cylinder American cars manufactured during that era.Good used Vegas are available at average prices ranging from $500 to $800. A real ""cream puff"" in ""mint"" condition costs from $1,200 to $1,300 tops. The Vega normally gets excellent gas mileage, from 16 to 20 miles per gallon in city traffic, and from 24 to 27 miles per gallon on the highway. Mileage can be boosted as high as 36 miles per gallon with engine modification.Most Vegas have only one serious flaw, a flaw that can be corrected easily and inexpensively with a specially modified engine created by IECO, Inc. of Santa Monica, California.The original factory Vega engine quickly lost power and started using excessive amounts of oil because it had defective cylinder walls. As a result, many Vega engines were ruined after only 15,000 to 25,000 miles of use. Many Vegas are not being driven, and are for sale at low prices because of this problem.The Vega engine's cylinder walls were defective because they had a silicon aluminum surface. Consequently, the cylinders became clogged with piston material. This material caused the piston rings to lose their seal, and created a frictional drag which reduced power, increased oil consumption and created catastrophic cooling problems.IECO, Inc. solved this problem by creating a special long-life engine for the Vega in which the cylinder walls are fitted with special alloy metal sleeves to completely eliminate the problem caused by the factory engine. The water jackets were also modified to improve engine cooling.According to IECO president, Raoul F. Balcaen III, this modified engine will easily last 100,000 miles or more without requiring any major service.The modified IECO engine is available either in a ""cylinder block"" or ""short block"" form. The IECO ""cylinder block"" does not have any internal components, and can be fitted with Chevrolet factory or IECO pistons, rings, connecting rods, bearings, and crankshaft. The IECO ""short block"" comes with all these internal components installed and properly adjusted.An IECO ""cylinder block"" costs $198.95 with the owner's exchange of his old block, one fourth the cost of a Chevrolet factory block. An IECO ""short block"" costs $405.95 with the owner's exchange of his old engine block, just a little more than half the price of a Chevrolet factory short block.Not only is the most for an IECO engine lower than a Chevrolet factory engine, but with a Chevrolet factory, the owner will soon have the same problems he had with his previous engine.For a few hundred dollars invested in a Vega, and a modified IECO engine the American consumer can solve his economy car dilemma. And, the Vega, also provides many advantages not found in new economy cars costing thousands of dollars more.The Vega is far more comfortable than many new compact economy cars and has more back seat and front seat legroom. It has ample cargo space, particularly in the hatchback models. It is a perkly little performer with excellent acceleration and handling characteristics. And, the Vega has sporty lines and a truly distinctive and appealing design that could ultimately become a ""classic"" since it is no longer being manufactured.IECO is now shipping modified long life engines for the Vega all over the world, certainly a proof that there is a demand for them and that a great many Vega owners want to get their Vegas back on the road, and keep them running efficiently, smoothly, and economically. And, the company also offers a wide variety of other engine, body, and suspension components for Vegas to give them better performance, a more attractive body, and greater fuel economy and performance than was originally built into the car by the factory.Photo (Above with the addition of a special long life engine, a Vega should run 100,000 miles or more without major service. Bottom left-The cylinder walls of a Chevrolet factory Vega after 25,000 miles the silicon-aluminum surface has become scored with piston material, which caused the engine to lose power, use oil and up.

The change, away from tired repetitions of ""experimental cinema"", is clear and welcome.Not that it was a festival of ""great"" movies; far from it. Quality fanged from mediocre to good enough. But, at least among the 15 films I managed to see beyond ""Elephant Walk"", there wasn't one that didn't at least make an effort to communicate something. Apparently, the era of punk movies, the lamentable period of talentless directors thumbing their nose at the public, is over.Seriousness of purpose, of course, is no guarantee of success. At this festival, at least, the bigger they were, the larger was the sound of the thud of falling flat. Italy's ""Masoch"" Wajda's ""The Conductor"" from Poland, and -- although I am in the minority here -- Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" are all big, large-scale (""Kagemusha"" runs 260 minutes), but not great.Complexity didn't help either. A U.S. entry, James Ivory's ""Jane Austen in Manhattan"", had a double play-within-a-play -- and it didn't work.The most memorable group of films shared a number of characteristics in a very clear manner although the artists making them are separated by thousands of miles. From locations as scattered as Hungary, Israel, the Philippines, Yugoslavia ad France came films that were small (and obviously on low budgets), clear, straight-forward, impressive in their effort -- successful for the most part -- to make a point without preaching, to contribute to thought and emotion, to enrich.Coincidentally, these films were all dealing with the theme of the individual's struggle with society or, rather, with society's political or economic oppression of individuals, from a viewpoint of new, warm humanism.Istvan Szabo's ""Confidence"", Dan Wolfman's ""Hide and Seek"" and Francois Truffaut's ""Le Dernier Metro"" are all set in war-time conditions, the Hungarian and French films during World War II, the Israeli entry in 1946, in the midst of the Jewish-Arab-British conflict.Goran Paskaljevic's ""Special Treament"" deals with ""curing"" alcoholics and Lino Brocka's ""Manila: In the Claws of Darkness"" with the crushing poverty and economic straightjacket in an urban ghetto.These films have all come from the new, No-Wave movie industry, representing an encouraging, heartening trend of simple, honest communications that go beyond entertainment, that give something important, something of value, to the audience.BELLA DAVIDOVICH, the redheaded Russian pianist, made yet another San Francisco debut Saturday night under the sponsorship of Today's Artists Concert. She first performed here last year with the Los Angeles, Chamber Orchestra (produced by TAC), then appeared with the San Francisco Symphony in an acclaimed concert.The Davidovich debut last weekend was in a Masonic Auditorium solo recital.The POST talked with the pianist before her concert and found out that she left the Soviet Union only two years ago and she did that in a remarkably simple way--she applied for an exit visa, waited six months, received the permit and left. The permit was to emigrate to Israel, but she changed direction in Europe and ended up in New York.What' difference did the change make for her?Evidently not too much. ""There is a routine, a cycle, in the life of a concert artist,"" she explained through an interpreter (she speaks Russian and German, still struggling with basic English), ""and the practice-concert-travel cycle is almost the same in Moscow and New York.""What makes the difference then?Small things, she said, such as better, cleaner subways in Moscow, a much better shopping situation in New York.As one of the few artists allowed to travel anywhere in the West, Davidovich had an unusual position in the Soviet Union and that helps to explain why there is no substantial difference for her between the two countries. She did not mention the issue of restraints in a totalitarian society.As a musician dealing almost exclusively with the Classical and Romantic repertoire, Davidovich never had the artistic restraints many of her colleagues in the Soviet Union must face. ""I am interested in listening to modern music, but I don't play much of it -- it's not my style,"" she said.Asked to describe what her style is, Davidovich talked of a ""Romantic, singing, natural"" sound.She lives in Queens, N.Y., but spends most of the time on the road, giving concerts and recitals around the United States and Euprope.

Bean Sprouts is a five part series focusing on the experiences of Chinese American children living in a diverse-cultural-community. The show demonstrates the humanistic value of being multi-cultural and multi-lingual.Community input played a major part in the successes and acclaims this nationally aired series has received. Produced by the Children's Television Project in San Francisco with the idea conceived by Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Association of Chinese Teachers. Bean Sprouts is the product of people familiar with and involved in the San Francisco Chinese community.The parents and children of San Francisco's Chinatown were instrumental in the program content and script. Contribution of ideas, talent and filming locations came from teachers, community workers and business people. Loni Ding, Bean Sprouts' producer recalls, ""I think if we had been Hollywood"", the people would have questioned it but as it was, they understood that we were what we said we were. Our being part of the environment made them think. 'You are trying to do something real so we will help you do it.'""In its first episode, Wei Min, a 10 year old Chinese American boy learns to accept his traditional background and integrate it into his contemporary lifestyle. The second program introduces Ann, a Chinese American girl, fighting to retain her individuality and cast aside the notion of the girl as inferior. It deals with the boy girl differences issues. These incidents show many of the problems one faces of the Chinese American experience.Unlike many children's shows, Bean Sprouts does not have a studio set. The lively combination of drama, documentary, music and animation moves into the homes of its central characters and their friends from other cultures. It explores the schools, the streets and shops of Chinatown, and other ethnic neighborhoods.Bean Sprouts represents the only nationally televised, authentic example of multi-cultural children's programs presented from the unique perspective of the ethnic group itself.

The stream of gold records (eleven RIAA certified disks to date), the Grammy awards, the critical and public acclaim have all confirmed her continuing stature and influence. A child of the 50s and a musical product of the 60s, Miss Flack is also a skilled producer, arranger, songwriter and pianist.Roberta Flack's impressive recording history represents only a portion of her musical accomplishments, however, for she maintains an awesome work schedule. She is on an orbit of year-round international performances ranging from the Americas through Europe and the Iron Curtain countries; from Africa to the Far East. When she is not either recording or on the road, public service work and Hollywood, Broadway, and television occupy her time.When Roberta Flack was four years old, her family moved from Black Mountain, North Carolina to Arlington, Virginia. It was there - at the Baptist Church down the street - that she first responded to the ""raunchy, wide-open, free, spontaneous, full-of-life gospel music"" that she heard from Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, the Five Blind Boys, and Mahalia Jackson.Roberta Flack has not surprisingly been called an ""international cultural heroine"". She has had a long-standing interest in education and would like to affect the way in which children are taught, not only in music, but in all subjects.

"894","",1980-06-29,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","SACRAMENTO (Capitol)--Statistics confirm that it is better to be rich than poor. But who are the poorest of the poor?Statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that they are usually women over age 60, who are widowed. In California women are the majority of older citizens in this state. By the year 2030 nearly 22 percent of the population will be over 60.Research and Forecasts Inc., in a recent survey found there are many negative experiences associated with aging such as financial stress, health problems, and loneliness. Elderly women suffer the most in these areas due to the fact that they have about half the income of elderly men.Older single women are among the poorest in society. While about 15 percent of all persons age 65 and over live below the poverty threshold ($2,572 per individual), set by the federal governments' ""poverty index"", 32 percent of all single women have incomes below this level and 50 percent live below the ""near"" poverty threshold ($3,215 per individual).Research and Forecast Inc., also found financial stress is the key threat to senior citizens, after health problems, to their well being and feelings of optimism.The California Department on Aging (CDA) reported there is a two-fold reason for the poverty faced by women: women have lived as economic dependents of men and due to discriminatory practices in the field of employment this has led them to be short-changed by the Social Security system.Upon retiring or reaching age 65 old age benefits are available to most people, the level of benefits is funded by the contributions of employers and employees, and is based on past earnings.Although CDA reports that the average monthly benefit for a retired individual is $234 per month, many women receive less than this because benefits are apportioned on the basis of past earnings and womens' earnings are seldom equivalent to those of men.The Consumer Price Index indicates that inflation has been on average 13 percent per year. Due to this rate of inflation, according to the survey conducted by Research and Forecasts Inc., the impact of financial stress on senior citizen's lifestyles has tended to make them very distrustful of the federal government as inflation is making their money worthless.In California, there are more than 700 congregate meal sites plus deliveries each weekday. CDA reports that this program is merely scratching the surface of the potential beneficiaries. If all eligible Californians 60 years of age or older were served by the nutrition program, the total cost would be $2.22 billion per year, 780 times greater than the current annual nutrition budget of $28.5 million.CDA reports there are an estimated 3 million seniors in this state and technically the Older Americans Act says they are eligible to participate in this program.Research and Forecasts Inc., have reported many seniors tend to ignore programs that would improve their income and markedly disapprove of the government's programs to help older Americans. Despite government and private planners' efforts to organize and support senior centers and groups, the majority seek their companionship and recreation elsewhere.Many women who are the poorest constitute what CDA has defined as the frail elderly, are especially vulnerable targets of crime. Awareness of increased vulnerability to criminal behavior has a chilling effect upon the freedom of movement of older Americans. Fear of criminal victimization causes self imposed ""house arrest"" among old people who refuse to venture out of doors.Crimes of force to which the elderly are the most vulnerable appear to be street crimes--particularly--the purse snatch directed toward elderly women as reported in the Police Chief Magazine.From research that has been done the chances are very good that women will not only constitute a significant proportion of California's senior citizens but they will be poor and live out their golden years in fear.Senior advocates ask, is this what California women have to look forward to?","1980",0,1
"895","Bresciani, Dennis",1980-04-02,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","An amendment assuring adequate protection of student rights during police questioning on school grounds was approved by the Oakland School Board last Wednesday.The amendment to the district's police procedures specifies that police can question students on school grounds only in matters pertaining to school or incidents of suspected child abuse.In addition students may not be interviewed by police on nonschool maters other than child abuse without written parental consent.Previously police were allowed to question students on all matters when they were unable to confer with students elsewhere.Under that arrangement police could question a student without parental knowledge until after the fact.The issue of police questioning of students first arose six weeks ago when Margaret Pryor, a representative of Oakland Citizens Committee For Urban Renewal, revealed that several students during school hours had been questioned ""by a police agency"" without parental consent.After the board reviewed the district's policy, it was amended on a motion by director Russel Bruno. Board director David Tucker cast the only dissenting vote.Bruno told the POST that he introduced the amendment to ensure the protection of student's rights.""Children should have the counsel of parents or even more,"" said Bruno who noted that only in cases of suspected child abuse or extreme emergency should police act without parental consent.Bruno pointed out the amendment protects a family's right to privacy, because it discourages police from inquiring about personal family matters.Margaret Pryor expressed satisfaction with the beard's move.""I'm very satisfied. I'm grateful that they moved so expediently"" she said.""Children don't know what to say when they are questioned by police. Children, can be used. They don't know the ramifications"" Pryor pointed out.Pryor indicated that the new amendment prevents police from intruding into the private lives of families.""A parent trying to get custody could pay an investigator who would question children without the guardian's consent,"" she noted as an example.""Besides there are other mechanisms where a child can be questioned.

"896","",1980-02-03,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","In December 1945, near Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt, an Arab peasant made an astonishing archeological discovery. What he found, hidden in an earthenware jar, were some 52 ancient papyrus texts, including gospels and other secret writings attributed to Jesus and his disciples.The titles--and their contents--amazed the scholars who first investigated them: The Gospel of Thomas, The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel of Truth, the apocryphon (""secret book""), of John, the Apocalypse of Paul, and many others.Some contained sayings and dialogues; others, meditations on the gospel, poems, myths, and instructions for mystical practice. All were Coptic translations from texts originally written in Greek, the language of the New Testament. Some date from the beginning of the Christian era--the period when the New Testament gospels themselves were written.The discovery of these so-called gnostic gospels, condemned and destroyed by leaders of the emerging church (c. 140-200 A.D.), offers us startling new perspectives on the history of the Christian faith. How, after all, was the early Christian movement transformed, within 200 years, into the church institution that called itself ""holy, catholic, and apostolic,"" headed by priests and bishops who claimed that ""outside (this) church there is no salvation?""We have long known that some Christians in the early churches resisted that development, and challenged the doctrines of those who called themselves ""orthodox"" (literally, ""straight-thinking"") Christians, but who were these dissident Christians? What made them--and their views--so dangerous that they were attacked as ""heretics"" (literally, ""sectarians"") by the church authorities? Before 1945, virtually all we know of them came from the polemics of their Catholic opponents. The Nag Hammadi discoveries offer us, for the first time, the opportunity to rediscover a major library of original gnostic texts: for the first time, the ""heretics"" can speak for themselves.What does this mean in relation to the New Testament? These discoveries disclose--surprisingly, perhaps--that gnostic Christians did not regard the gospels they revered as rivals to the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. On the contrary; Gnostic sources show great reverence for the canonical gospels. The first Commentary on John was written, in fact, by the distinguished gnostic teacher Heracleon; other gnostics wrote extensive commentaries on Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Many gnostics revered Paul, after Christ himself, as their greatest teacher.But gnostic christians claimed to have access as well to other, secret sources of Christian tradition, hidden from ""the many,"" from the mass of ordinary believers. They recalled that, according to Matthew and Mark, Jesus himself taught his disciples secretly what he withheld from the crowds gathered to hear his public teaching (""To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given""), Matthew 13.10-11; cf Mark 4.10-12. Paul, too, declared that although he taught ""secret wisdom"" to those he found to be spiritually ""mature,"" he found most Christians unready to receive it (I Corinthians 2.6-13).But the most striking--and most fundamental--teaching of the gnostic gospels is that Christ directs the believer to discover the divine within. According to the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus says, ""If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."" Jesus goes on to explain that the Kingdom of God is not a ""place"" in spatial terms, but a state of spiritual awareness: ""That Kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living Father."" The Gospel of Philip declares that whoever becomes spiritually mature becomes ""no longer a Christian, but a Christ.Are these texts authentic? Do they reflect early traditions concerning Jesus? To answer these questions is difficult. Most of the gnostic writings probably date from the second century and later; scholars currently are debating whether--and to what extent--they contain earlier tradition. Yet the Gospel of Thomas not only contains sayings paralleled in Matthew and Luke, but also presents them in a more primitive form. This suggests that Thomas itself may be one of the sources (i.e., ""Q""), that the authors of Matthew and Luke used in writing their gospels; alternatively, these evangelists and the author of Thomas may have used the same early sources.","1980",0,0

Jerry Brown predicted that wind energy will sweep the state in the next few years and reaffirmed the goal of having wind power supply 10 percent of California's energy by the year 2,000.Brown, who met with wind development firm representatives and utility executives in San Francisco today said that with the current push he believes the state can produce at least 500 megawatts of windpowered energy by 1987.""Wing power is quickly becoming competitive"" economically with conventional sources of electric power, Brown said at a press conference in the State Building following the meeting. As resources such as oil and gas become more expensive in the future, Brown noted ""wind power promises to become cheaper once manufacturers begin mass production.""""Wind energy could save California up to 40 million barrels of oil per year by the end of this century,"" he asserted.The state will spend about $16 million out of its Energy Resource Investment Fund over the next five years, Brown said, ""as an incentive for wind power."" In addition, the governor said he is urging the state Public Utilities Commission ""to give favorable treatment"" to wind power proposals.Brown says he visualizes the economics of wind power as a ""shared risk"" that should be spread between utilities, ratepaying customers and the state.""A lot of people view wind energy skeptically,"" Brown said. ""In the same way that we viewed airplanes, trains and steamships.""But, the governor says, ""The potential for wind power in California is as great as all of the energy now being used in the state.""Two potential sites for windmills in the Bay Area are the Carquinez Straits where an estimated 500 megawatts could be produced and Altamont Pass, where a possible 1,000 megawatts could be generated.At the press conference, Brown also touched on his role in the Democratic convention coming up next week, reiterating his stance that he won't come out in favor of any candidate.""I feel, after having run for president and being unsuccessful, that the most constructive thing I can do is to work toward influencing the election -- not the nomination,"" he said.""There's going to be a certain amount of bloodletting"" on the convention floor.

A taxi screeches to a halt and the student thought he had a ride. Instead the cab driver rushed from his car and punched him to the ground.

Perhaps Shakespeare himself will be on hand to audition performers for a new production.Other Faire stages brim with the bawdy comedy of Italy and peasant's pageants of the day.England's ancient harvest rituals are celebrated with robust good cheer. The Mummer's plays, the children's circle games and the blessing of the bounty harvest at the market cross all symbolize the cycle of seasons, rebirth and renewal. Folklore comes to life beneath the ancient oaks.Country and courtly dances are performed in the streets and on the stages. Visitors can tread a spirited measure, learning dances from the allemande to the jig with the Faire's good folk.The Faire's half-timbered stalls and many-colored tents house handsome and authentic crafts, from the functional to the frivolous.

Since the last basket was tucked away sometime in May, the Golden State Warriors have been wheeling and dealing draft picks, forwards, guards and centers.The moves have completely changed the looks of last year's losers, and I guess the feeling by the Warrior brass was one of ""We can't go anywhere but up.""Trading Robert Parish for the first pick in the draft kicked off the rash of moves that started the metamorphosis. For Parish the W's begot Joe Barry Carroll, a sure fire, can't miss big center that could turn the club around. That is if Scotty Stirling ever signs him.To help complement Carroll, the Warriors traded Phil Smith for ""All World"", Lloyd Free. All that did was to give Al Attles a low post center, whereby he had gone with Parish from up high, and a shooter supreme, if he feels like showing up. Lloyd has been very hot and cold throughout his career when it came to getting along with his employers.In the trade, the Golden Staters gave up dependable Phil Smith who played his head off whenever he was in the lineup. The school is still out as to whether Phil plays better defense than Free, but everybody knows that Lloyd has almost a 30 point per game shooting average, and gets on the free throw line very often. These attributes are badly needed by the Warriors because they have been seen very rarely taking free throws since Rick Barry left.All right, so they had Carroll, Free, Rickey Brown along with John Lucas, Sonny Parker, Purvis Short et.al. That seemed enough to start a new regime. Forget it. The next step was to unload a big salary and they sent Jo Jo White packing. That was a good move because they needed more money to pay salaries.So what happens next? Al Attles and Company pick up the priging PECK'S HAD BOY . . . Ling as one helluva . . . player but he has gotten himself into more trouble throughout his career than John Dillinger. No he doesn't rob banks, but when Bernard sips the sauce, crazy things happen. Now King is really an articulate, polite, extremely good-looking and clean cut guy, but the alcohol has been doing a number on him. I remember a great wide receiver who used to score TD's for the Raiders by the name of Warren Wells. Warren was a nice quiet fellow until he entered a bar and then terrible things used to happen.It has been said that Bernard King has joined AA, and that all his transgressions are behind him. I hope so for his sake, as well as Attles and the Warriors. Al has stated that the trade for King is a gamble. He is right, and the trade for Free is also a gamble, but if the cards come up ACES, the Warriors are going to give some people fits.Attles has the job of leading all this talent, and moulding them into a team that can play together and get into the playoffs. Never again will anyone accuse Frank Mieuli and his staff of doing nothing during the off season. It should be an interesting year.","1980",0,0

""Most studies so far have only dealt with a few dozen or maybe a hundred patients. And they have not gone into detail about dosage, type of cancer or type of treatment. Our proposed study would include up to 7,500 patients with many different types of cancer and many types of treatments.""The study was set into motion last year when the legislature passed a bill authorizing such a study in California. The panal was set up to deal with the myriad of federal agencies and regulations with which the study must cooperate.Now, after ten months of work, including training sessions, registration of over 300 physicians and 85 pharmacies and loads of paperwork and red tape. Dows says the doctors and patients are awaiting delivery of the drug but federal officials have suddenly displayed a reluctance on their part.One reason may be that the National Cancer Institute (NCI) may be in the process of developing their own nationwide study and the NIDA may have decided to give their supply of marijuana to the NCI rather than California, but according to Dow, NIDA officials have been vague about their reasons for the delay in supplying the drug.As Dow describes the study, it would involve four separate plans. One would include use of the (the active ingredient in marijuana) capsules for patients undergoing radiation treatments, one would involve THC capsules for cancer patients in the 5-14 year old age group, one would involve THC capsules for hospitalized patients and the fourth plan would be marijuana smoked in ciagrette form by adult patients who receive occasional chemotherapy treatments.Dow said the patients using THC capsules may require up to 100 vapsules every three months and that about 50,000 marijuana cigarettes may be needed over a six-month span for the testing.""They really get sick,"" Dow says of some chemotherapy patients, ""almost to the point where they refuse treatments. They would rather die. So this research could be very important.""Senator Robert Presley, D-Riverside, who authored the legislation authorizing the experiment, is trying to enlist Senator Alan Cranston's help in prodding the federal government to come through with the promised supply of marijuana but to date no headway has been made.Dow explained that the experiment, if they get the drug, will concentrate on studying how well the marijuana controls nausea and vomiting as well as increased appetite, a desirable condition for most cancer patients.As far as negative side effects, Dow says they will be looking for panic reaction, severe drowsiness, nervousness and depression and dizziness due to low blood pressure.""Basically the idea is to determine whether the side effects are tolerable or intolerable. We are looking to see the effectiveness of different dosages, different scheduling of the doses and different reactions from various types of cancer patients and patients undergoing different treatments. We have it all worked out, and at first the NIDA said there would be no problem supplying us with the drug, but now thay are holding back on delivery.""","1980",0,0

The rest come from California communities from Bakersfield to the northern border.Kirkland said that delegations from across the country have unanimously agreed to also ask the government to balance the budget and restrain inflation.""Inflation is really rocking us,"" Kirkland said, adding that small businesses don't have the same access to the money market that larger businesses do.The conference, which runs from January 13 to 17, will also tackle issues that include taxation and equity for small businesses, government policies for small business, procurement and foreign trade, government regulations and paperwork, and minorities, women and veterans in business.Another concern that the delegates will take to Washington is a recommendation for changes in the Small Business Administration. Kirkland said the delegates think the administration should be overhauled to make it more responsive to the needs of the business community.One area the delegates are not unanimous about, according to Kirkland, is what position the government representative of small business should have.Some delegates think it should be a cabinet post, Kirkland said. But the Northern California delegation fears that action would make small business policy decision more politically oriented than they already are.","1980",0,1

"913","",1980-03-19,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","""Do you know a handicapped child who is not getting the special help he or she needs?""This is a question you may hear soon, because a new program---SEARCH & SERVE---is being organized in Alameda County. Many community organizations, hospitals, churches, businesses, schools, and individuals will be asked to help in an intensive search to see that children with special needs are identified and receive the best possible program to meet those needs.There have always been routine screening programs operated by public and private schools and agencies, and most exceptional children have been identified that way. However, every year the school system discovers several of these children who have somehow slipped through the net and are not in school at all. The intent of SEARCH AND SERVE is to locate these children before they miss valuable years of special help. Educators believe that early intervention and training can make a big difference in how well these children learn to overcome their disabilities.Key to the success of the educational program are the parents of the handicapped children, who are involved in every step of the identification and placement process. In California, the schools are asking more of parents than just their permission to proceed with testing. Now parents are becoming actively involved in designing an Individualized Education Program (IEP), that takes into account the needs of the total child. This program may include special education teachers who visit the regular classroom to work with one child, remedial speech or P.E. classes during part of the day, special classes for severely handicapped or emotionally disturbed children, or in extreme cases, home or hospital instruction. The IEP is different for each child, and changes periodically as that child progresses.All of these programs are free. In Alameda County, the public schools are required by law to provide an appropriate program for each handicapped child from kindergarten to age 18. In some instances, there are also special programs for infants and young adults to age 21. If an appropriate program is not available in the public school system, the state may pay for placement in a private program.","1980",1,0

She then met and married her husband Sydney Eggett and quit college.The Eggetts lived in the Bay Area and raised five children before retiring to Placerville. After her husband's death Mrs. Eggett moved to an Oakland senior citizen's complex where a college program was offered by the Peralta Community College District.The grandmother of 17 and great-grandmother of 10 decided to enroll and ""finish my education.""Somewhat taken aback by the attention paid her by news reporters and television cameras Friday night. Eggett recalled that when resuming her education in 1973, a mix up developed over what courses were transferable from Fresno Jr. College.The misunderstanding, Eggett said, stemmed from the fact that courses offered at Fresno Jr. College were considered an extension of high school courses.""They put me down for math instead of calculus, history instead of political science and physics instead of college physics,"" Eggett said.The snafu was further complicated when Eggett was given credit for courses she took in 1910 instead of 1911.Once the matter was squared away. Eggett enrolled in her first two courses, philosophy and English taught by two teachers who had been sent to the senjir citizen's center.Eventually Eggett became a full-time student at Laney after starting off at two courses a semester. Later on, a hip operation forced her to slow down a bit.Thus her program at Laney consisted of a math and language major along with general education requirements. She earned an A grade in trigonometry and was at one point progressing with a 4.0 grade point average.Her accomplishments resulted despite illegible handwriting, apparently aggravated by her Parkinson's disease, dependence on a cane due to her hip problem and the use of a hearing aid.Photo (Mrs. Beulah Eggett, 88-year-old Laney graduate, holds up a mock diploma as she prepares to go to graduation ceremonies Friday.)","1980",0,0

It represents one way in which the Oakland Arts Council is attempting to encourage the integration of arts and cubture into the city's overall revitalization plan. The program has been made possible by the funding of the Arts and Recreation Strategies Program by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service of the United States Department of the Interior.While Oakland is one of six cities participating in this program, it is the only one which has focused on the introduction of cultural planning into local neighborhoods whereby citizens are actively engaged in the cultural planning process as a permanent support for the overall revitalization of an urban center.The idea is that integrating arts and culture into local neighborhoods will benefit the entire community. Arts Council Coordinator and Program Developer, Gloria Murphy sees the program as a way to ""bring people and families back together and to give them the feeling that neighborhood facilities and cultural programming belong to them: North Oakland is part of a demonstration pilot program which will help us illustrate how cultural planning linkages within local neighborhoods can be implemented and used as a model for other parts of the country."" Murphy cites studies showing that cultural planning and development spurs economic and employment growth by attracting industry. Symposium Chairperson, Amahra Hicks, points out that the development of neighborhood arts can help to solve many urban problems by enriching people's lives, especially young people.""Even though North Oakland may disagree on many issues, it has the unique ability to work together for the benefit of the entire community and the question of arts and culture is one of the community's priorities,"" states Bill Lowe, Chairman of the North Oakland District Community Council. North Oakland artists Chet West, youth workshop facilitator and Jimmy Evins, Chairman of the artists committee, believe the program will help local artists to break out of their isolation. ""I need to find other young artists for support,"" West says. ""A program like this can do that and it can provide exposure for artists and get others involved.""The symposium has been designed to include remarks by public officials and North Oakland citizens followed by a panel discussion and workshops on topics such as cultural needs of North Oakland youth, children, elders, handicapped; how to use existing facilities; the role of the artist in the community, the obligation of municipal planning to neighborhood cultural development, etc.There will be a slide presentation on how art is integrated into everyday community life in Ghana, Mexico, Paris, San Francisco, and North Oakland and exhibits by local artists.

Saturday, June 1st to protest nuclear development, uranian mining on Indian lands, and draft registration.""We must assume a moral responsibility to walk against and bring attention to what is happening now,"" said Dennis Banks, national director of the American Indian Movement.The walk will begin with a ceremony June 1, at 7 a.m., on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay followed by a car caravan to Sacramento for a rally. From there, walkers will follow the same route to Washington the group took in 1978, in ""The Longest Walk.""Banks said no government officials will be addressed in Sacramento or Washington. The walkers plan to arrive in Washington on Nov. 1, the Saturday before Election Day.The walk's foremost objective is to rally public sentiment against nuclear development and uranium mining on Indian lands, particularly in the South West. Banks said radioactive contaminants from uranium and nuclear activities are seeping into the water supplies of nearby reservations causing spontaneous abortions amongst pregnant women, deformed newborns, and shorter lifespans. Indian workers, he contended, experience a higher incidence of cancer.""There is an alternative to nuclear development,"" he says.Banks advocated closing the mines and putting Indians to work manufacturing solar panels. That can be done ""with minimum expertise. Banks, chancellor of the Indian University near Davis, California, said students there solarized former military barracks saving $165 average monthly fuel costs.Banks strongly opposed the draft for Native Americans. Indians are ""an endangered species"", he said, and full-blooded Indians will probably become ""extinct"" within a century or two and fighting a war could only speed up that process.""There aren't very many Indian people,"" Banks said, ""there are less than one million and even fewer full-blooded Indians and unless we act to preserve our population, then you'll see extinction.""Banks said it is hard to predict exactly how many will walk but 50, compared to 24 in 1978, have pledged to begin the walk. Those numbers are expected to increase daily. In 1978, 200 people walked most of the way and 9,000 had joined them by the last day.Representatives from Japan, England, and France have pledged to walk in an international call against nuclear development and environmental destruction.Two Buddist representatives from Japan will walk to convey the ""Asian message"" in memory of thousands who died in the American atom bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Banks said he will not join the walkers because of extradition threats from his native South Dakota where he faces criminal charges in connection with violent Indian protests.People in cities along the 1978 walk route were ""very receptive"", Banks said, in expectation of similar treatment for walkers this year.Banks said the intent of the 1978 walk was to rally support against 11 bills which subsequently were defeated. Banks attributes their defeat in part to letters, telephone calls and telegrams sent by sympathetic citizens along the walk's route.""Now we believe that a similar walk must be in order if we are to bring attention to what is happening,"" Banks said.","1980",0,1

But PG&E is using it right now.The utility has found arrays of the cells to be a practical and economical way to help collect meteorological data, to operate low-power remote alarms and transmission devices and to power some seismic recorders.In some cases, the panels are used instead of large banks of expensive batteries. The batteries needed to be replaced every five years. The solar cells cost less and last longer.In other areas, the cells eliminate the need for expensive electric line extensions. Pacific Gas and Electric's communications department uses the cells in place of thermoelectric generators. The generators needed periodic refueling, more maintenance and had a shorter lifespan then the photovoltaic cells. They were also costlier.The cells PG&E use cost between $300 and $500, depending on size and design, and they should last at least 20 years.Current technology seems to limit the cells to low-power uses at remote locations. A 10-watt array, for example, may cost $500 but would only light a 10-watt bulb. PG&E is working with Westinghouse and Southern California Edison to develop solar cells that will be economically feasible for widespread use.""We much prefer the solar cells,"" said Dean Gilson, PG&E's supervising communications engineer. ""Not only are they less expensive, but they are more reliable. And the only fuel they need is sunlight.""A photovoltaic cell is made out of silicon. It generates electricity when photons, the ""particles"" in a beam of light, knock electrons loose from the atoms they strike. When this happens in a solar cell, the semiconductor properties of the silicon cause the electrons to flow in one direction across a junction. That creates voltage. When circuitry is added, current flows and electric power is available.Margaret L. Mooney, PG&E's supervising meteorologist, said the solar cells do not actually power the field devices directly.""What they actually do, is to keep a 12-volt battery charged. That battery powers the device.""Adverse weather conditions do not impair a solar-powered instrument's performance, she said. The batteries enable the device to operate for about three weeks without sunshine.Pacific Gas and Electric uses the meteorological information to anticipate its customers' energy needs.Pacific Gas and Electric's meteorological department uses arrays of the cells capable of producing eight watts to power equipment used to record meteorological information and to power equipment used to operate cloudseeding benerators.The utility's communications department has been using arrays up to 30 watts to power remote alarm and data transmission systems. For example, more than twenty such installations are used to monitor and control crucial water levels.Five watt, solar cell arrays are powering seismic recorders in several remote areas. The recorders are activated only during significant ground motion and require only low-power batteries.""It's reached to the point,"" Ms. Mooney said, ""that we consider solar power the rule for some types of installations, not the exception.""","1980",0,0

""We have many deaf employees and students in the District,"" she remarked.The proposal for the purchase of a TTY was brought before the Board of Education by Board Vice President Russell Bruno, who had been working privately on a consumers' guide with the Center for Independent Living, a Berkeley agency that provides services for the handicapped.""Being familiar with the kinds of things that were going on in that area,"" Bruno said, ""I realized the District did not have certain facilities. For example, I knew we did not have a terminal for communicating with deaf persons.""The TTY, which is connected directly to a telephone, consists of a keyboard just like that of a typewriter. When a deaf person wishes to communicate with someone who has a TTY, he types on paper the message, which is then transmitted via telephone lines.The receiver is notified of an incoming call by a flashing light attached to the unit. Built-in buzzers are available for hearing users.Tom Falcon, grants manager for the Deaf Counseling and Referral Agency in Oakland, said that of the estimated 486,000 persons with hearing problems in the Bay Area, about 40,000-50,000 have been certified deaf.Few in that population actually own a TTY, probably due to the cost. The model purchased by the Oakland School District cost $995, but a more general price range is $500-$1,000, according to George Polos, general manager of Micon Industries, a local TTY distributor-manufacturer.However, the number of TTY's can only be expected to increase as California State Legislature late last year ordered the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), to provide a means for distributing TTY's free of charge to all persons certified deaf.

H. Jackson, president for over two and one-half decades, relates the actions of the Convention to civil rights, political, social and religious happenings of the last century, in both domestic and world affairs.Dr. Jackson not only presents the documented facts, he offers an analysis of the situations from the viewpoint of one who has been an eyewitness as well as having made a careful study of historical and current influences, to events such as the formation of the World Council of Churches, debates over John F. Kennedy's qualifications for office, Civil Rights Act of 1957, voter rights and school integration.Much of the material came from the Joseph H. Jackson Library in Chicago, founded by the Convention in 1973.The volume is scheduled for publication by the Townsend Press to coincide with the Convention's centennial celebration in Birmingham, Alabama, September 9 - 14.This history records a prophesy fulfilled. It is not a series of unconnected stories, but a progression of documented events that give credibility to the theology of Dr. Jackson as the leader of the Convention.The book begins with a concise history of the early Negro church in America which disproves some commonly held perceptions of the uneducated, flamboyant or agitating preachers.The development of the Convention is traced carefully from the 1880 origin of the Foreign Mission Convention whose purpose was to support, with money and personnel, mission work in Africa without asking others to do what they could do for themselves. The Convention is described as missionary in origin, self-giving in motive and redemptive in its outreach for the welfare of others. It has never been an anti-white group, but rather pro-production and pro-freedom.This line of thought recurs throughout their history. The ""Christian Activism"" of the title means first of all Christian with principles of equality, brotherhood and religion, which then is supported actively by deeds in harmony with both religion and the laws of our land.The Convention has supported the civil rights struggle because, as Dr. Jackson stated in 1947, ""The church cannot stand aside and blame the leaders of civil rights organizations. The church has a right to enter into this field wholeheartedly and do III within its power.""Dr. Jackson's philosophy is best summed up in this 1961 statement, ""All Americans must unite in the struggle to render this nation free. But in this struggle we must employ American techniques to win our victory over these forces... We must go beyond protest to production, for at best protest wins an opportunity for one to participate fully in the cultural, political, economic and spiritual things in American life.""Concern for education and youth and self-improvement are dominant throughout the Convention's activities. Under Jackson's leadership the Convention has given approximately $50,000 in scholarships to winners of an annual oratorical contest, as well as numerous endowments and scholarships to colleges around the country.The theme of economic self-sufficiency has been continually preached. In addition, history reflects strong action taken by the Convention in the form of ministerial retirement funds, capitalization of outstanding debts and projects such as a mass farming effort in Liberia and the Freedom Farm in Fayette County, Tennessee, a productive home for Negroes denied their voting rights.Dr. Jackson inserts comments of preaching and praise as well as exhortation in practical matters such as ""It is not wise to talk big and to spend big and then to save and invest little""; ""We as a race are also responsible for helping to save and serve our nation""; and ""Parents must teach their children to make the fullest use possible of every available educational opportunity.""Actually, this book is a simple story -- that of a Christian group and its leader who have responded positively and non-violently to the worldly pressures around them for 100 years.It makes excellent reading for both those who were involved in the heart of civil rights changes in this country and younger readers who want and need a conservative view of American","1980",1,0
"929","Hart-Banks, Susan",1980-03-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Oakland's condominium conversion ordinance was amended last week to help alleviate some of the stress on renters, but not without some criticism that the city council did not go far enough.City Planning director, Norman J. Lind, presented the amendments to the council based upon the recommendations of the mayor's Task Force on Condominium Conversions and the Planning Commission.Those amendments include a stipulation limiting conversions to those developers who have earned ""conversion rights"" attained only by producing an equal quantity of rental housing stock. Limited-equity housing cooperatives along with housing intended to become the property of the Oakland Housing Authority were excluded from the ordinance.Council action on the conversion ordinance will be continued in upcoming sessions, said City Attorney Michael. Lawson. After all council decisions regarding the ordinance are made, the current moritorium will be lifted and the amended ordinance will take effect.However, conversion applications filed before the moratorium was enacted, such as the DOAN Corp., conversion application for the Parkwoods Apartments on Caldecott Lane, will be heard and judged based upon the old conversion ordinance.DOAN's offer will be heard by the council tonight at 7:30 p.m., in the regular council session.Under the amendments, new condominium projects could be built when the developer guarantees to rent the units for a period of not less than seven years. The property must then be sold as a whole and not to investors, said Lind.Proposed conversions will be denied, if it is found that the project would have a ""negative impact"" on the rental housing stock in the immediate area. It could still be considered if the developer agrees to replace each converted unit with a rental unit in that same section of the city.Councilmember John Sutter expressed his concern that developers would deplete the housing stock even as new units are created by tearing down older buildings to build newer units. Lind replied saying that although there could be some demolitions the city could limit them through the present demolition ordinance.Another amendment to the conversion ordinance provides life-time leases for tenants age 32 and over with stipulated rent increases and benefits.Converted units must also meet noise insultion standards equal to newly constructed units and developers must submit informational reports on condominium buyers and displaced tenants.One citizen, John Campbell, told the council the amendments failed to meet the needs of the lower and middle-income renter. He said that few people can afford to rent new rental units due to high construction costs. He advocated alloting between five and 15 percent of the present rental stock for those renters.James Van of OCDAH (Oakland Community Development for Affordable Housing), informed the council that three other Bay Area cities, Palo Alto, Cupertino, and Marin, already have provisions in their ordinances setting aside affordable housing.Upon Councilmember Sutter's recommendation, staff was directed to look into those ordinances, but action was not taken on the matter then because it was believed to be a separate issue from the proposed amendments.The amendments, and the staff directive were passed 8-0 with Councilmember Wilson Riles, Jr., absent from council activities that day.Also before the council that night was a measure to approve a contract with the S.J. Amoroso and Verrett Construction Companies for the building of Firehouse One, the fire department headquarters, at 16th and Grove streets because the present one is being displaced by the new city center project.Interior designer and architect, Betty Hamilton, questioned the council decision to hire a non-minority, Foster City-based firm saying ""There are many minority construction people who could do this work.""City Manager David Self explained that the Amoroso-Verrett bid was the lowest. He said, the firm could possibly meet cigy quotas for minority participation (51 percent of work force and 18 percent ownership) and that the city is presently investigating the company for such compliance.The council voted 8-0 to award the contract to the companies.In other council action, a Planning Commission order for the removal of debris on a lot at Edes and 105th Avenues was reinforced. Based upon president of the Sobrate Park Homeowners Association, Phebia Richardson's plea charging that the owner of the ""4.3 acres"" of property was procrastinating, and is waiting until the property is sold three to six months from now to remove the ""junk"" when the Planning Commission had ordered it's removal by last Friday.The council promised to do everything legally possible"" and instructed staff to charge the owner with abating and nuisance. Councilmember Frank Ogawa also requested staff to look into legislation requiring property owners to post bond when such complaints are made as an incentive to remove nuisances when the city orders it or face the loss of the bond money.","1980",0,1

"931","",1980-11-13,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Calling wild animals is by no means unique to the modernday hunter -- even though he has the advantage of some mighty sophisticated equipment.Centuries ago, the American Indian and the Eskimo learned that they could imitate the voice or sounds of various kinds of wild game and bring them within bow and arrow or harpoon range, according to Popular Mechanics Encylopedia. To them, it was a matter of survival. You either called successfully or you didn't eat.But today, modern, efficient instruments are made to call just about anything. You can even get portable record players for attracting predators.Among upland game there are callers for wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, pheasants (in a sense), Hungarian partridge and squirrels.The duck callers include quackers (black and mallards) and whistlers (pintails, wood ducks and widgeon). Goose callers are made for Canadas, blues, snows and whitefronts (specklebellies). Bird callers are reed instruments made from walnut, cherry wood or plastic. Some are more exotic models made from zebra wood or mahogany. For the sound, you must blow from your diaphragm, not just from your mouth.The fife devices bugle in bull elk and entice buck deer. These are made from bamboo, rubber or plastic. Bears may even come to some predator calls. The moose is still called with the voice, using a birchbark horn as an amplifier.The range for predator calling is great. These reed calls, which imitate the squalling of a terrified cottontail or jackrabbit, will bring foxes, coyotes, big cats and many other animals on the run. Even cows and mother rabbits will respond.Then there are distinct callers for crows and magpies, owls and hawks -- again reed calls. Audubon Society members even use a little squeaker to bring songbirds within close range.But why do these creations of wood, metal, rubber and plastic work? Several principles seem to be involved.Some work because the animals involved have strong flocking instincts. Scattered wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, ducks or geese want to find more of their kind and will respond to imitations of their voices. They're lonesome.Many kinds of game can be called during the mating season. Some species thus deluded are the moose, wild turkey, dove and horned owl.Still others seem to answer to challenge when they think another male is invading their rightful territory. Bull moose, bull elk and deer all get fighting mad when someone is able to imitate the throaty cough, bugling or low grunting of these big game animals. In parts of the West, buck deer are brought to the hunter by rattling two antlers together. The wild tom turkey may come to a gobble on a box caller with fire in his eyes, when it's springtime in the mountains.Predators which come to a rabbit squeal or mouse squeak are looking for food. But they are just as likely to be fooled by the limitation squeal of their own young. This response is obviously a protective instinct.Then there's curiosity. Deer will answer a predator call, as will many other kinds of wild game which certainly have no intention of eating a rabbit. Domestic cattle and horses behave the same, often come on a dead run. Maybe they want to be where the action is.And finally, there's the reverseaction effect. Hunters in the know often use a hawk caller to hunt pheasants. Pheasants notoriously run before a bird dog and may never stop to permit a point and a shot. However, a blast on a hawk caller and the pheasant will usually ""freeze"" in its tracks and stay put. He's scared to death to move for fear the hawk he hears will swoop down on him. So, the dog points, the hunter moves in and there's a bird in the bag.Learning to call game successfully is more than a matter of becoming adept on the mechanical device itself, although this is mighty important. It takes hours of practice to be able to get just the right note or tonal quality. The smart hunter practices while listening to the animal itself or to a good instructional record. You can get these records for a reasonable price. Better still is a tape recorder. With a small cassette type, you can record game in the off-season, practice, and be ready for opening day.But knowing something about the habits of wild game is just as important. The hunter has to know where to find his quarry and where to place himself for best results. For some animals which aren't color blind, like the wild turkey, you may find it necessary to wear camouflage clothing. Turkeys, ducks, geese, coyotes and elk don't miss much and all operate under the theory that ""every stump is a man.""The nimrod is warned against the reckless use of callers, too. Well hidden hunters yelping like a turkey have been filled with fine shot. Brush shooters have been known to take a ""blind"" shot at another hunter rattling antlers or bugling for elk. The best rule for the hunter is to leave his back open to view and to screen himself in front only where he can see anyone approaching.But actually, calling game is safe enough it and it's most certainly one of the most rewarding ways to take game or to get good pictures.For further information on Popular Mechanics Encyclopedia write Popular Mechanics Encyclopedia, Dept. 1114, 250 W. 55 St., New York, N.Y. 10019.","1980",0,0

The information had been released to an FBI agent who was working on the pretext of census business during the 1970 census. No employee meant to devulge information to the FBI, Baraba noted on a recent visit to Oakland.Part of the problem, according to Broadus Durant, a field operations supervisor, stems from residents feeling they are not a part of the system thus their existence doesn't count.For example he pointed out that undocumented workers believe that by responding to the census they risk deportation.But in accordance with census regulations no information is to be passex to other United States department including those dealing with immigration.Census information remains confidential due to a device that picks up penciled material, but not an individual's name, according to Mary Parker, community services specialist for the census.The office of community services works with various community organizations in emphasizing the importance of the census and how the information gathered is relevant to the community.The information gathered by the device is then microfilmed and stored by address for 72 years.The stored information, Parker said, can only be used during an age search for social security reasons if an individual has no rpoof of birth.""Only certain bureau employees have access to that information,"" she noted.Information gathered by the census is used for determining funding for services pertaining to housing, job programs, planning of mass transit and other services.","1980",1,0

Jasmin laughed and said, ""Berry, it's just beautiful."" What a beginning as we toasted the captain on his artistry. It was all uphill from there.WOMEN ARE MORE OUTSPOKEN... Turning to Jasmin, our waiter, Mario E. Urguilla, said women are more outspoken, ""They will compliment you on good service, and let you know of improper service. That's why I think they are beautiful. This young lady glows with beauty. You, air, are very lucky."" Smiling, I said, ""I agree."" Soon our waiter brought us 'Saumon Fume' (smoked salmon), followed by Supreme De Crabe Demolselles Du Gold' (selected Gulf Prawns). In between, our captain, Robin Wade, poured us 'Foume Blane white wine.' Each service was like a painting, Jasmin stated. Our next 'Huitres Fraiches Sur Glace' (fresh blue point oysters) looked too beautiful to eat. What followed blew my mind. 'Hot Les Huitres Rockefeller' (oysters Rockefeller). You see, the others were all cold hors d'oeuvres.One would have to visit ""Hugo's One Up"" to believe what we are writing about. It's a restaurant of beauty. 'Les Scampi Maison' (hot scampi) followed by 'Prosciutto Ham and Melon"" ended our hors d'oeuvres.NEW DINNER WINE...1975 Chateau Belair, Saint-Emilion, was served by our captain, as Mario, our waiter, served us Lobster Bisque, spread with sour cream and caviar. A delicious soup, followed by watercress soup, filled with hazelnuts called Creme' De Cresson. During our dining we talked to Jasmin about her background. The difficulty was that as we talked, another item would arrive for us to eat. Finally, Jasmin said, ""Berry, it looks like we may have to talk about my background at another time."" Toasting, I said, ""Jasmin, I agree.""HEWS MEDIA COVERING A RESTAURANT...Now you may not find all the items we have mentioned, but they are on the menu. As Matre' D Hotel, Keoin McDermott stated, ""Berry, our plans are to let you and the lovely lady sample a few items on our new menu."" For our salad, Robin served 'Calamaris, Shrimp, Prawns and Scallops,' followed by 'Spring Lamb,' delicately seasoned with special spices, mustard and an assortment of fresh vegetables. This item on the menu was called 'Carre' D' Agneau A' La Moutard,' service for two. The entire evening, one we will remember, was a seven-course dinner. It would take too long to spell out all the outstanding specialities. Our last 'Le Filet Boeuf Wellington' (seared filet of beef garnished with a slice of Pate' (encrusted in puff pastry and baked) blew both Diane's (the name change I discussed) and my mind. We will do an interview on Diane at a later date.SEVEN COURSE MEAL...As the night lights of the city lit up the San Francisco sky, the warmth in the elegant Hugo's One Up gave each diner in the room the relaxation one needs when dining out. The beautiful deserts, not only in taste, but in service, also blended together like a symphony orchestra. The final touch, 'Chatea Romer Du Hayol, Sauternes 1975,' served with 'Souffle' Au Chocolat and sauce,' ended one romantic evening, beautiful in many ways. On the menu I saw a gen, ""La Nouvelle Cuisine,' a new technique which retains the art of traditional French culinary knowledgs, but dispenses with the use of heavy and rich ingredients. We offer you the pleasure of fine dining, with a lighter touch. We would like to add to this phrase, 'Any meal is only as good as the way it's placed on the plate. The decoration of the table, the manner in which it is served, and finally, the time you take to enjoy it.' Leave out any one of the ingredients and the entire meal is flat. There is a famous saying, ""Eating is like painting, take the time to enjoy it."" In closing, we must mention again Matre D' Keoin McDermott, Captain Robin Wade, waiter Mario E. Urquilla, and busman Patricio Bustos. A dozen red roses to Sandie Wernick, Director of Advertising & Public Relations for the Hyatt On Union Square. Let us say this, we have dined in many restaurants, throughout the country, and Canada, and we put Hugo's One Up very high on the list. Now that the hotel strike is over, and you may be planning a night out to dine, do yourself a favor and try Hugo's. Take a lot of time, and let any one of the staff treat you in splendor. They enjoy it! Take the time to dine...and take someone close to your heart along...e-n-j-o-y. WE KNOW THAT JASMIN DID!Hego's One UP-Hyaft on Union Square in Downtown S.F.","1980",0,0

"937","Obermeyer, William G, Jr",1981-01-16,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Most seismologists and geologists agree that within this decade California will suffer an earthquake of high magnitude. Is your family ready? What would you do if an earthquake struck right now? Most of the answers, from people I've talked with, fell into three categories; 1) Who cares? 2) I'll just get under something. 3) There is nothing I can do. If it strikes, it strikes. If you responded in one of the above ways, read on. And if you feel you already are prepared, you may find this article interesting.Well, you ask, what can we do? First, get your family together and have a talk about the possibility of an earthquake. Develop a family plan of action. A plan has two very important purposes. One, it gets your family talking about earthquakes. This discussion will help your family express any fears they may have about earthquakes and perhaps eliminate those fears through discussion. Secondly, it will give each member of the family a course of action when the event occurs. With a plan, valuable time is saved. You will know what to do. The valuable time saved may save your life or the life of a family member.There are several topics to discuss for your family earthquake plan. Consider:1. Storage of food and water: Where is a safe place to store it and how much should you store? Keep in mind it may take two weeks before water and food will be available through normal sources.2. Main gas shutoffs and electrical power supply switches: What are they? Where are they located? When should they be turned off? How do you shut them off?3. Family medicines: Where will they be kept? Who needs them?4. Family separation: Where will you meet after an earthquake, if your family is separated? How long will you wait before you start to search for missing family members?These are some of the basic questions to ask while putting together your family earthquake plan. Because each family is unique, each family plan will be different. The main point is to make a plan of soon as possible, TODAY, and develop your ""Family Earthquake Plan.""Take that first aid course you've been thinking about. Your local American Red Cross offers very good first aid courses at a low cost.A little planning and preparation will increase your chances of survival and enable you and your family to live a little more comfortably after the earthquake.Get your home in order, apartment or house preparation is important, too. In studies of past erathquakes it was found that most deaths and injuries were caused by either falling ro flying objects. Look around your home; you will probably find many heavy items like book cases, art work, china cabinets, etc., that could topple over and cause injury to anyone nearby. Most of these items can be bolted into place and still maintain their aesthetic appearances. Place large, heavy objects on lower shelves wherever possible. All gas appliances should be securely bolted to wall studs or the floor. All gas lines should be of the flexible type. The flexible tubing is inexpensive and it may keep your house gas line from breaking and causing a fire. If you have any doubt about installing these flexible lines, please call a professional. They can do the replacement job quickly and safely.Also, during an earthquake, the violent shaking could cause the roof to slide off your house or the house itself to slide off its foundation. Make sure that the roof is bolted securely to the house and that the house itself is bolted firmly to the foundation. If you find that either the roof or the house is not secure, have it secured as soon as possible to prevent excessive damage to the house and its contents. If you are a handy person, go to the public library and look under ""Earthquakes and buildings"", in the card catalogue. You will find a lot of information on how to earthquake-proof your house. If you don't want to do the work yourself, look up a local contractor in the yellow pages of the telephone book.In summary, develop your ""Family Earthquake Plan"" and get your house in order. DO IT TODAY!Don't bury your head in the sand like an ostrich and hope it won't happen. Remember, you live on the West Coast and that's earthquake country. BE READY! DO IT TODAY!!!William G.

"938","Marable, Manning",1981-01-20,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","SECOND PART OF A FOUR-PART SERIES OF ""FROM THE GRASSROOTS""The joint endorsement of Abernathy and Williams highlighted a small yet significant move by some influential blacks toward Reagan. Two influential black newspapers, the Cleveland Call and Post and the Atlanta Daily World, supported Reagan. Dr. Nathan Wright, one of the black militnats from the mid-1960s and convener of the 1968 Black Power Conference in Philadelphia, also backed Reagan. Mayor Charles Evers of Fayette, Mississippi, brother of the assassinated civil rights activist Medgar Evers, suddenly announced his opposition to Carter's reelection. He informed reporters that he would not endorse Reagan, but he urged his supporters to vote against Carter. Both Evers and Abernathy had actively supported Kennedy for the Democratic nomination. One reason for Evers' move, he admitted, was that Carter had not appointed a single black Mississippian to a position in his administration.Carter's black supporters reacted viciously--there is no other word--to the Abernathy/Williams endorsement of Reagan. One black newspaper reporting the Detroit event described the two as ""deposed civil rights workers"" who ""have been removed from their SCLC positions and are seen as being virtually without followers."" Coretta King voiced the suspicion that mysterious ""forces"" were behind the endorsement. She reminded blacks that her late husband had believed that the California conservative ""represented the negative elements in our society--even...irrational elements."" Bishop H.H. Brookins, leader of the 2 million member African Methodist Episcopal Church, declared that Abernathy had ""stepped out of line with the tradition of (King)."" The Reverend Thomas Kilgore, head of the Progressive Baptist Convention, warned that Williams was ""persona non grata at the SCLC."" Black columnists throughout the country were less than charitable in interpreting Abernathy and Williams' motives. Typical of the caustic commentary was the assessment of Lloyd J. Earles of the Fort Lauderdale (Florida) Westside Gazette. In one column, Abernathy was described as a modern ""Brutus"", an ""Uncle Tom"", and ""Judas""; a ""senile"" misleader who had ""thrown mud on a martyr's grave. Our excompatriot Abernathy"" had sold out the interests of the black masses in order ""to nourish (his) own ego and/or self-gain."" Earles concluded, ""Abernathy and Williams are considered turncoats by many, if not most, black Americans who remember the police dogs, Selmas, Birmingham, the marches, the sit-ins, the kneel-ins, the pray-ins, Bull Connor, the jails, the beatings, the bombings, and the humiliation...""Carter was not above such tactics himself. Throughout the last six weeks of the campaign, Carter aides authorized a series of advertisements claiming that the Republicans want to defeat the President because he ""appointed black judges and cracked down,"" against job discrimination. Over one hundred black owned newspapers carried the advertisement. A number of anti-Anderson ads were carried on black radio stations in a number of cities, including Detroit, Chicago, Albany and Erie, Pennsylvania. Black baseball star Hank Aaron was hired by Rafshoon Communiations to state that as a Republican Congressperson from Illinois, Independent Presidential candidate John Anderson voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Anderson, who voted for both pieces of legislation termed Carter's ads ""false and scurrilous. This is a deliberate act of sabotage."" Carter refused to pull the ads off black stations. Anderson denounced Carter's decision ""a desperate attempt to hang onto the black vote."" But Anderson and the progressive third party candidates, notably Barry Commoner of the Citizens' Party, were never important political factors in the black community. Carter recognized finally that he had to turn ""the race issue"", in the words of the New York Times, into the ""cutting edge of the 1980 election."" As James L. Smith, a black municipal union leader in Memphis related to that newspaper, Carter's best hope for a substantial black turnout was ""to tear Ronald Reagan to pieces"" as a racist.Carter ""began using the White House as his reelection pulpit"" in his campaign to hold the black electorate. Before the Abernathy Williams endorsement, SCLC President Joseph E. Lowery had refused Carter's request for support. Three weeks later, on October 23, Lowery and the SCLC publicly endorsed Carter in a White House meeting. Two hundred black ministers were ""invited on 24 hours' notice all around the country to come to the White House"" for the announcement. Carter was careful to say all the right things to his conservative black congregation. The ""depraved people"" responsible for the murders in Buffalo and Atlanta must be ""tracked down by the FBI and prosecuted by the Justice Department."" Dr. Manning Marable teaches political economy at the Africana Studies Center, Cornell University, and is a leader of the National Black Independent Political Party.","1981",1,0
"939","",1981-01-21,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","""Automobile accidents are the number one cause of death among children--ahead of all other types of accidents and all other diseases,"" says Thomas K. Hunt, M.D., UC-San Francisco Professor of Surgery and Ambulatory and Community Medicine and president of the American Trauma Society. The purpose of the ATS is to promote research and education on the treatment, causes and prevention of serious injuries.In California alone, Dr. Hunt points out, more than 100 child auto passengers are killed each year and more than 13,000 are seriously injured. Tragically, 85 percent of these deaths, and most of the injuries, could be prevented by properly securing the child in a crash-tested car safety seat. Only 9 percent or less of children in California are riding properly restrained in automobiles, he emphasizes.To focus public attention on the problem, the American Trauma Society and the San Francisco Child Passenger Safety Council, an ATS affiliate, will hold an educational conference for civic and business leaders and community leaders on Friday, January 23, at 9 a.m. in the State Building Annex, Rm. 1194, 350 McAllister Street.Mayor Dianne Feinstein has been invited to the conference to proclaim the following week, January 25-30, as ""Child Passenger Safety Week"" in San Francisco. Other participants will be the Child Safety Council chairman, Martin Gershman, M.D.; Donald D. Trunkey, M.D., UC-San Francisco Professor of Surgery, Chief of the Surgery Service and head of the Trauma Center at San Francisco General Hospital, Janet Goodson, Executive Director of the American Trauma Society; and Boyd Stevens, M.D., San Francisco's coroner.Persons wishing to attend the conference should call the American Trauma Society at (415) 821-8211 for information.According to Dr. Hunt, some of the goals of the Child Passenger Safety campaign are:* To alert the public to the dangers of allowing children to ride in automobiles without being ""buckled up"".* To urge parents to obtain properly designed safety seats and to use them correctly. Such seats should be labeled, on the box, ""dynamically crash tested.""* To make physicians, nurses, other health practitioners and those who deal with famileis, aware of the problem so that parents will be instructed before the baby is born on the importance of the proper use of child safety seats.","1981",0,0

"943","Weekes, Berry",1981-01-23,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING...As we jogged recently around Lake Merritt two Super Bowl bets went down. ""Berry,"" the jogger said, ""who do you think will win the Super Bowl? Let's bet on the game."" The jogger was pretty Marge Gibson of the Oakland City Council, decked out in a light blue jogging suit. ""Where is your Raider Silver and Black,"" we asked Marge. Laughing, she said, ""If the Raiders win, you can buy me the silver and black jogging suit."" IT'S A DEAL, Marge, if they lose you buy me some new Nike's running shoes. Shaking hands on the deal, we took off on the continued seven-mile run, smiling along the way. (This is one bet I hope I lose, she's a super lady and good city council member.)SUBSCRIPTION TO THE POST...After the run we stopped at the store to buy some grapefruit juice, only to run into Paul Cobb. ""Berry, who's going to win the Super Bowl?"" Paul asked. You guessed it, if Paul wins, I will buy him a subscription to the Post. If I win, Paul will treat me to dinner. ""Berry, let's have dinner anyway and celebrate the victory,"" Paul stated. It's a deal, Paul, I said smiling. Somehow they both talked me into taking the Eagles over the Raiders in the Super Bowl.MONA LISA EATING PIZZA...To complete our Sunday, after the bets we were invited to the opening of Petar's Restaurant in Lafayette at 32 Lafayette Circle by Bob Tuttle of the San Francisco Progress. Entering the closed party we spotted first the Mona Lisa painting with the super large pizza painted into the painting. As I was staring at the painting, Tim Murphy, manager of Petar's, then showed me the painting of the Blue Boy holding a large salami in his right hand and a loaf of bread under his left arm. Murphy went on to say that Mitch, owner of Mitch's Sirlion on Grand Avenue in Oakland, had the painting done at Maxwell's Gallery in San Francisco. Many media writers and friends attended the dinner party including Bill Fiset, Bob Tuttle, Bill Dobson, Bill Alex, Lloyd Johnson, Tom Dooley, and Nancy Ripsteen, to name a few. In the midst of the party the lights went out, in fact the entire area of Lafayeete was dark for three hours. The very nervous owner Petar Jakovina ran around lighting candles, as did the waitresses, explaining to the media it won't be for long. Somehow we all enjoyed the darkness, intimate surroundings and attractive waitresses. Soon after hors d'oeuvres were served and some drinks. Finally the lights came on to the cheers of all the media, their wives or girlfriends. Just as fast they all screamed turn out the lights. Within seconds the power went out again, to screams of joy. It was a very fun evening and we were all finally served a great dinner. We said to Petar, ""You couldn't have planned this evening in Hollywood, it was fantastic."" As each writer left Petar's restaurant they all laughed and said to Petar: ""I know my lead."" The moral of the story, Petar said he plans to lower the lights, as all the media cheered.BLACK HISTORY WEEK...Last year during Black History Week an Oakland Hills School's kindergarten class with one black child took all the children to Housewives Market in downtown Oakland to look at pigs feet, chitterlings, black eyed peas, pork belly and salt pork, to name a few, and other soul food items that Blacks eat. When the black youngster went home and told her mother of her trip, she hit the roof with words. Have no fear, this year during Black History week, the same school with again only one Black enrolled in kindergarten will come to the Post to see how a Black-owned newspaper is put together.CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CARIBBEAN.

Areas affected are those served by the City of Richmond Water Pollution Control Plant and include Point Richmond, Iron Triangle, Downtown, Civic Center and Mira Vistas areas.Testing will be conducted by Paul Soltow/Central Engineering, Associated of Richmond CA, under a sub-contract with Kennedy/Jenks Engineers of San Francisco, who is Richmond Municipal Sanitary District's consulting engineer.According to project manager Paul Soltow, smoke-testing is part of the City's continuing program of sewer system maintenance and improvement. Work is scheduled to be performed through March, 1981.The test invoves injection of a harmless smoke into the sewer system. Normally smoke will exit the plumbing vents and will not enter residences or business establishments, except where faulty plumbing of sewers exist, in which cases small amounts of harmless smoke may be present.Residents will be notified of the smoke-testing by leaflets and will be given a number to call should they have any questions. During testing, questions may be directed to field crews who will be present in the streets.The purpose of the program is to locate improper connections and leaks to the sewers, including surface drains, storm sewers, and roof gutters. Soltow said that many improper connections and leaks are believed to exist because of excessive flows at the sewage treatment plant during rain storms. By locating leaks and improper connections, the City can take steps to correct the problem. This can reduce raw sewage bypassing to the Bay and minimize additional construction at the sewage treatment plant.","1981",0,0

The tenants had notified Valiyee in early January that they would begin withholding rent in February unless he complied with the city's eight month old rent and eviction law by registering his rental property with the Rent Board, Board Chairman, Richard Illgen said, ""The Court decision shows that retaliatory evictions will not be tolerated."" He said, ""Mr. Valiyee could have avoided the entire situation by following the law.""The Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Valiyee must refrain from attempting to evict or harass those tenants withholding rent until another lawsuit concerning rent registration is resolved. Two weeks ago, the Board filed suit against Valiyee and another major Berkeley landlord, Andrew Lipnosky was dropped after he registered his rental property with the Board. The remaining case against Valiyee will be heard February 23 in Superior Court. The Board has indicated a willingness to drop the case against Valiyee if he registers.In addition to the eviction notices last week, Valiyee served his tenants 24 hour rent increase notices in Janaury. Both state and local laws require a 30 day written notice to increase rents, and the local rent ordinance prohibits rent increases on unregistered rental property.

Here is a team like San Diego that lives by the bomb. The running game keeps you honest, but Sipes is a talented gunner, and if he is allowed time to throw it is sayonara.On the other hand, the Browns are not as adept on defense as was Houston, so that Jim Plunkett should find some openings for the Raider running game and passing game.Before the playoffs started, I opined that Cleveland appeared to be a tougher team than Houston. I was overruled by my writing colleagues. Therefore if they are right, the Raiders should beat the Browns.One advantage has to go to Cleveland. Besides having the home field advantage, the Browns are more used to cold and inclement weather than are the Raiders. This could be a big factor if the weather is near the zero mark.Other than that, if the Raider defense can get to Sipe as often as they did Stabler, the Silver and Black will win.....SAN DIEGO VS BUFFALO...The Bills had the toughest defense in the AFC at the end of the season, but in their last few games, Buffalo was beset with injuries to Joe Ferguson and others. After a week of rest these hurts may have healed. Even so the Bills were better earlier in the year.Dan Fouts and the Chargers have the most explosive passing offense around. In addition, Chuck Muncie has given the Chargers a running game. Together with their league leading sack team it makes San Diego very well rounded. Buffalo will have to play over their heads to win.....PHILADELPHIA VS MINNESOTA...The Eagles were another team that seemed to run out of gas toward the end of the season. They have a well-balanced attack and are no slouches on defense either.Minnesota has a fine quarterback in Tommy Kramer and they always make it tough in the playoffs. I really can't see the Vikings beating the Eagles at home, but stranger things have happened.....DALLAS VS ATLANTA. The Cowboys proved that their overwhelming loss to the Rams on Monday Night Football was just one of those things. Dallas played a great game in their win over LA last Sunday, and should do well against Atlanta.The Falcons are a big play team, and they have great running to go along with their passing game led by Steve Bartkowski. With the home field advantage, the Faloons could prove that they are indeed a great team.They will have their hands full with Danny White and Company, who just happens to be coached by Tom Landry.

"955","",1981-02-03,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","A stop at the supermarket meat counter has come to mean a painful lunge at the pocketbook the same stop for that all-important animal protein sometimes also means breaking the daily budget of calories for the weight-conscious. These dual dilemmas have prompted many people to turn to cottage cheese for high-quality protein without spooning up the calories.Just one-half cup of cottage cheese fills more than 25 per cent of an adult's daily requirement of protein. That same half-cup contains just about the same amount of protein as two eggs or a medium, two-ounce serving of fish, poultry or lean meat.The protein of cottage cheese is considered ""high quality"" in that it contains all of the essentials necessary to build and maintain the human body. Conversely, many vegetable proteins are incomplete, which means that ehy don't do a fully adequate job of tissue maintenance. Yet even those proteins can be used better by the body with the addition of a source of complete protein, such as cottge cheese.While the protein of cottage cheese is high, its calorie content is less than half that of a comparable serving of many kinds of meat. The uncreamed variety of cottage cheese, with its generous 19 grams of protein (daily requirement for an adult woman: 55 grams), has a stingy 98 calories per serving. Even creamed cottage cheese, containing four per cent fat, has only another 22 calories per serving.One of the most ancient of foods, cottage cheese has a versatility unmatched by many other sources of protein. It fits in easily with the traditional fruit salads, but also adapts to meat dishes and casseroles. Have you ever considered topping pancakes with cottage cheese and jelly? Or adding it to lunchtime sandwiches? Such tangy varieties as cottage cheese with chives make excellent additions to vegetable dishes. Even baked potatoes become more exciting when eaten with cottage cheese.So adaptable is cottage cheese that it can be used either to give variety to the milk portions of the diet or as a meat substitute. Officially, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, cottage cheese is classed as part of the Milk Group in the Four Food Group classification (meat, milk, vegetables and fruits, breads and cereals). But it so high in protein that cottage cheese can actually be used in place of meat or fish in a meal, allowing it to fit easily into the Meat Group.Time was that the Pennsylvania Dutch made their cottage cheese by letting three quarts of skimmed milk stand in a warm (not hot) place for three days. When the solids began to separate from the liquid, boiling water was added and cooled. The whey floated to the top while the curd sank to the bottom. A little salt for seasoning helped force out the rest of the whey. A touch of cream was used to moisten the curd if it was too dry.Today, the same basic process is followed in the commercial production of cottage cheese, although of course on a much larger and more scientific scale. The main difference now is that producers add lactic acid to get the process started sooner.DATE LOAF(3 loaf pans, 2"" x 7"" x 3"")1/2 cup butter3/4 cup brown sugar2 teaspoons grated orange rind2 teaspoons grated lemon rind2 eggs1 1/2 cup creamed cottage cheese1/3 cup orange juice3 cups sifted flour3 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon soda2 cups dates, choppedCream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Now wait a minute. That guy playing the drums ... wasn't he on keyboarfds a minute ago? And how about the one who's playing the keyboards now ... wasn't he on trumpet?Relax, you're not going crazy. That's just Switch -- Jody Sims, Bobby and Tommy DeBarge, Phillip Ingram, Eddie Fluellen and Greg Williams -- doing what comes naturally. Lots of other bands carry on about their versatility, but the six men of Switch give new dimensions to that overworked word; not only does the band move easily from thumping dance tunes to captivating ballads, but onstage, it's not at all unusual to see them move just as easily to one another's instruments without missing a beat. Put simply, Switch ... switches.If you're thinking that it takes men of enormous talent to hopscotch around a stage like that, you're right. And that talent hasn't exactly gone unnoticed recently, either. Switch debuted on the Motown label two years ago with an album entitled simply, Switch. That album, aided by an infectious hit single called ""There'll Never Be"", quickly joined the elite ranks of platinumselling LPs.The group followed that triumph up last year with a double-punch. The Switch II LP quickly became another top seller for the group with hit singles for the snappy ""Best Beat In Town"" and the lush favorite, ""I Call Your Name"" To say that Switch is among the brightest new stars in the celebrated Motown firmament is to make a rather obvious observation.It wasn't, of course, always like that. Before hit records and stardom came. Switch was like any of a dozen other young bands searching for that proverbial ""big break."" And when that break came, it was in an almost fairytale manner. One day, Jody and Greg found themselves standing next to singer Jermaine Jackson in an elevator in the Sunset Blvd headquarters of Motown.The two musicians approached Jermaine and asked him to listen to a tape of six tunes the group had recorded in an $83-a-day studio in Mansfield, Ohio. Jermaine liked what he heard and got back in touch with the group. The result of that contract, of course, is well known -- a contract with Motown and a pair of hot albums. So impressed was Jermaine with Switch that he even contgributed his time and talent toward polishing and refining the group, and wrote and produced a handful of tunes on those two albums.But now, watch out! Switch is pulling out all the stops and Reaching For Tomorrow as the title track of their new LP puts it.

"958","",1981-01-01,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","If you are buying a new house, you may see it under construction, or see what the contractor is building into nearby houses. If you are considering an older house, you'll have to hunt for clues to good construction.Here are some tips from Popular Mechanics Encylopedia about construction features to look for when you are house-hunting:1. Foundation walls of poured concrete usually are better than cinder or concrete-block walls. Block walls should be plastered with 1/2 inch of cement mortar on the outside. In high-quality construction they are reinforced with steel.2. Troweled-on water-proofing is better than the brushed or sprayed-on type.3. Drain tile installed at the base of the foundations gets rid of ground water that otherwise may get into the basement.4. Exterior walls on a new house should have a primer and two finish coats of top-quality paint. In an old house, find out when it was last painted. Depending on weather, paint quality and other factors, you'll have to paint every three to six years.5. Interior walls may be lathand-plaster or gypsum wallboard. As the house settles, lath-and-plaster is more subject to cracking. On the other hand, in skimpy construction thin 3/8 inch wallboard is too often used. This damages easily and allows transmission of noise. Wallboard should be at least 1/2 inch thick, and preferably 5/8 inch. The best wallboard consists of two layers of board, the first nailed to the studs and the second cemented to the first.6. Flooring should be hardwood preferably oak, smoothly installed. Often, in kitchens and in rooms which will be carpeted, no hardwood is installed. Instead, a sub-floor of plywood is put down, and the floor covering laid over it. There is no point in paying for hardwood you will never see.The floor of the kitchen gets lots of wear and present-day kitchen floor coverings are both durable and beautiful, and offer easy care. If the floor is relatively new count it as a plus. If it is quite old, figure on replacing it.7. Windows and doors, in more severe climates, should be weatherstripped and have storm installations. In older houses, check for looseness and for windows which won't open.8. Kitchen counters should have a durable surface, preferably a plastic laminate or ceramic tile.9. Electric outlets should be well distributed throughout the house. The National Electricity Code calls for an outlet every 12 feet of wall space, and a light switch near the door for every room. Check the kitchen for two separate 20-amp circuits strictly, for appliance use.10. Bathrooms should have waterproof walls and floors. The best are finished in ceramic tile. Plastic tile and hardboard tile panels also are used. Areas around the sink and tub should be tiled. Look for good quality electric and plumbing fixtures, with recognized brand names. An enameled castiron tub is considered top quality, preferably with a shower enclosure. Avoid plastic tubs.Bathroom faucets should be brass coated in chrome or nickel. See that they don't drip or leak, that they turn easily, and that sink and tub drains work properly. Flush the toilets to check the noise and the flushing action.Plumbing is difficullt to check. Turn on a water faucet to check pressure and rate of flow. If slow, be wary. The town may have low water pressure. More likely, the water pipes are too small or are becoming clogged with lime deposits.There should be a shutoff valve for every water fixture in the house. Listen for ""water hammer"" as you turn the faucets on and off. This banging noise is easily cured by installing standpipes in the system, but that adds another cost to the price of the house.Photo (Workman Robert Alford inserts insulation around the door frame of a home under construction in Columbia, South Carolina.

"959","Wilson, Lana Kay",1981-02-10,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","When Merritt College decided to institute and field a football team after a two year absence this fall, little did they know they would receive a rookie running back, named Elton Veals, who would break every Merritt record and give the college a respectable 5-4 conference record and a 5-6 overall mark.But that's exactly what happened. The 6-2, 218 pound, 19 year old freshman sensation from Baton Rouge Louisiana amassed 1,688 yards on 220 carries, a y.5 average, while scoring 17 touchdowns. Impressive statistics, undoubtedly, which is why Veals was named most valuable player of the season and was unanimously voted onto the All-Camino Norte team.On the field Veals is aggressive dominating and mean, yet off the field he is reserved and quiet, nothing like the charging tough runningback who bulldozes his way into end zones carrying three or four players with him.Over lunch, Veals discussed how he became interested in football. ""I've always like it, whether I'm watching or playing it but I prefer to play. ""Actually, it all started in the fourth grade. We had an elementary league, which is something similar to the Pop Warner.""I knew I was tough then,"" jokingly adds Veals.As time progressed his toughness was no joke, at Istroma High School in Louisiana, Veals received All-District Awards for the offense in 1977, 1979, and 1980 as well as joining the roster for All-State and All-American in his senior year.Coming to California was not an easy decision for Veals to make. ""I had my family and friends there, friends who I played football with. One in particular was Frank Jackson, we I just wasn't sure I'd like it. California is okay but its not home. I remember Coach Keiffer telling me at Southern University, he said, ""You have the potential to be one of the best, that stuck with me and gave me a lot of motivation.""One of hte most notable things about Veals is his dedication. I never doubted he'd be a fine athlete, he's just a natural. I think he can go all the way says Coach Keiffer. He gives 100 percent on the field and is a good example to his teammates.Every college player has some professional athlete who they immulate and it should come as no surprise who Elton patterns himself after--Walter Payton. ""It takes as many men to bring Payton down as it does me and we both have that lightning quickness,"" he said. There are pretty strong statements but keep in mind Elton does have the records to back them up.With primarily all the top honors a football player can receive and the scouting which goes along with it, you may be wondering why Veals decided to go to a junior college. ""Well, it was my grades. I needed to bring them up before I could go to a at Merritt and I'm working a lot harder."" Finding a college to play football when he transfers won't be much of a problem, he has several scouts clawing at him, Paul Hackett of U.S.C. as well as coaches from UCLA, Illinois, and Las Vegas to name a few, and the calls keep rolling in. ""Coach Keiffer told me one day that he wasn't going to be my answering service,"" laughed Veals, the phones kept ringing off the hook.""As a freshman Veals has plenty to decide where he wants to play football. ""I haven't given its much consideration says Veals hesitantly. I have somewhat considered my choices and probably out of all of them I'd chose USC."" Why USC? ""Why not, statistically more pro players come from USC."" Why USC? ""Why not, satistically more players come from USC."" So in essence its the prestige? ""Yeah,"" smiles Veals, ""its the prestige which comes along with winning the Heisman Trophy, thats my main goal. To go to the right school and win the Heisman, and I think SC is the place to do it.""Elton Veals is to football what Magic Johnson is to Basketball, phenonemal.Photo (Elton Veals)","1981",0,0
"960","Hasan, Mustafa",1981-01-25,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Dear Beloved People:We extend the greetings of Peace Be Unto You, As-Salaam-Alaikum. We pray and ask for guidance and mercy and forgiveness from Almight God Allah, the one and only Creator and Sustainer of all the worlds.Our topic for today is Faith, in Arabic the word is Iman. The purpose for choosing the topic of faith for today's article, is to serve as a continuation for last week's article on who is responsible for the education of our children. Last week we discussed the need for setting good moral examples and for parents to take responsibility for the upbringing of their children. The solutions and steps that have been outlined, can only work in one's individual life, if the efforts are backed up with consistent performance. Wanting a change, wanting something good and beneficial in one's family life and community life is not enough. We have to go to work to put our faith into practice, into our everyday deeds and actions.There is much confusion about faith. Many people confuse faith and its meaning with desire; some with inolination; some with motivation. All of these are incorrect. Faith should shape and form our desires. Our faith, to be lasting, enduring and fulfilling, has to be faith in Almighty God; faith with impulse or one's own will. Faith is belief. Belief leads us to gain feelings. Our feelings should lead us to seek knowledge. And from knowledge we gain understanding. As human beings, we have been formed in the best of moulds, with the nature of submission to truth, submission to the will of Allah.As human beings, we have the capacity to grow and develop and acquire knowledge and to alter and change our environment. As human beings, we live and die, we have unlimited capacities to develop in righteousness and moral excellence; and we are limited by our lack of knowledge. We are human beings and we make mistakes, we have weaknesses and faults, we commit some sins. The reality of the nature of the human being should be a light unto our intellect and consciousness, that only Allah, Almighty God is the high and mighty. Only Allah has all knowledge, all power. And we should readily understand that there is no success and no power except with Allah, the Lord and Cherisher and Sustainer of all the worlds.As Muslims, we recognize that the human beings learn and expand their knowledge through the grace and blessings that come from Allah. The first revelation of the Qur'an given to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was Surah 96 which states:""Proclaim or read, in the name of your Lord and Cherisher/Who created; Created man out of a mere clot of congealed blood./Proclaim or red! And they Lord is most bountiful./Who taught mankind the use of the pen/Taught man that which he knew not.""Surah 96, the first revelation of the Gur'an given to Prophet Muhammad, clearly explains that the affairs of life, for which we take such pride, our intellect and wordly accomplishments, our very life's development from a clot of blood and fetus, in the womb of the mother, all of these comes as a blessing from Allah. Faith, dear beloved people, is therefore more than just belief. We move from belief, to feeling, feeling to knowledge and from knowledge to understanding. In order to move along this path, there must be some trust.The performance of trust and being faithful to one's principles are important in translating belief into action. All of the documentation on the life and history of Prophet Muhammad indicates that he was the finest example of ""el-Amin"" the faithful and trustworthy one. This is an example that is worthy of emulation.One's performance, one's deeds show the world the degree of your faith, and indicate what it is you have faith in, what it is that you worship; and give your life's energies to. We have to strong in order to receive blessings of Almighty God. Peace of mind and words of faith amount to nothing without the action and behavior and deeds to back up that faith.The person who aspires to submit their life to the will of Almighty God, to be a Muslim, is one who has faith, and is one whose faith is materialized in good deeds and works. Works are not accepted in the eyes of Almighty God without correct performance. We may ask, what is acceptable? How do we know when our deeds and actions are acceptable?The Qur'an tells us what is acceptable. The Qur'an tells us how people who want to live right can change their life and live by truth and accept God's guidance. The Qur an is Almighty God's guidance to the human being. The Qur'an is a universal book with knowledge to guide all persons, from every society,country, and walk of life. The guidance is there if you accept its lessons, and practice its principles.Due to the amount of confusion about principles, values and the goals and directions of life, that we find in our present environment and society, we in the United States of America, the Bilalian (African-American) community have been blessed with additional resources and guidance. To aid us in coming into the knowledge of the way of the Prophets, the teachings of the Qur'an, and the mission of remaking the world and dignifying our people, we have the leadership of IMAM Warith Deen Muhammad.Imam Warith Deen Muhammad is a man from among us, who has been blessed by Almighty Good Allah, to gain a clear understanding, a good sense understanding of the Qur'an. This knowledge and understanding he shares with the world. Through his example as a family man, a teacher, a worker, an economist, a world respected and renowned leader, we can learn how to apply the teachings of the Qur'an into our daily lives.","1981",0,0

To qualify, buildings cannot be owner-occupied and must contain two or more rental units.The $7,793,000 to be used for loans in the rehabilitation project were raised through a bond issue by the City of Oakland. Bank of America will make the loans and handle all of the paper work involved. Under the agreement, the bank guarantees repayment to the city of all funds loaned.""We expect this program to be one of major benefit to qualified owners of older apartment buildings,"" said Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson. ""This is because the 'Loans to Lenders' program creates a unique source of loanable funds that are not easily obtainable in these times of high interest rates and tight money.""In commenting on the ""Loans to Lenders"" program, Jim Young, assistant vice president for the bank's Rehabilitation Community Improvement Program, said, ""History has shown that public and private sector partnerships can solve many of the problems which plague urban centers. We believe that by working together, the city and the bank can provide the opportunity for qualified rental property owners to take care of their building's rehabilitation needs and provide viable and desirable housing possibilities for Oakland residents.""In November 1977, Oakland's Office of Community Development began a precurser of today's ""Loans to Lenders"" program, when it provided some $1.3 million in loans for housing rehabilitation. The program was formally called the ""Marks-Foran"" program and those loans were created by using $900,000 in community development funds. That program evolved into the present lending project, which uses no city revenue.""The city is very pleased iwth the current program's evolution. Working with Bank of America we were able to produce ten-to-one leverage of our federal funds for housing rehabilitation and further pursue the city's commitment to its neighborhood improvement,"" said Dave Self, city manager.All loan applications for the ""Loans to Lenders"" program will be processed through the real estate loan department at Bank of America's Oakland Main Office, located at 1200 Broadway.

We saw a need to initiate a proper tribute. With that in mind, we contacted Earl ""Fatha"" Hines and he agreed to the concept of the tribute and he chose to perform. He envisioned a re-creation of the Grand Terrace Review, and we proceeded to try to gather support for that.We approached several foundations as well as the business community to help underwrite the tribute the original date being January 31, 1981. A member of the business community promised support for our budget if we changed the date to March. We changed the date and yet he did not follow through on his promise. We had also hoped for support from the City, and we approached City Council. We were sent to the Ways and Means Committee. We still were not successful.

It was sold overseas after the American recall and is still in common use in some countries.--No one knows how many children may develop cancer since several million children's garments treated with a crcinogenic fire retardant called Tris were shipped overseas after being forced off the domestic market by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).--Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive banned for such use in the United States because, it caused malignant tumors in beagles in monkeys, is sold by the Upjohn Co. in 70 countries where it is widely used in U.S.-sponsored population control programs.These are just a few cases of hard evidence of ""dumping"" and its tragic consequences which have repeatedly been brought to the attention of federal agencies, the Congress and the White House. An estimated $1.2 billion worth of unsafe goods are shipped overseas every year. The dumping is said to involve, not only manufacturers and retailers but export brokers, tramp steamers, black marketeers the United States Export-Import Bank and the Commerce, State and Treasury Departments.Although the bottom line motive is always profit, hazardous products are dumped to solve different problems. For manufacturers--wholesalers, retailers, brokers, importers and exporters--the problem is generally just a matter of (useless) inventory. Salvation often comes in the form of a broker, offering to buy the banned goods at a ""close-out"" price for resale in the Third World market.The president of the United States can place any product he wants on the Commodity Control List, which makes exportation of the product aboslutely illegal. There are three statutory justifications for placing a commodity on this list scarcity, national security, and foreign relations.In Washington, the liberal compromise on the dumping issue is notification. Invoking the principles of national sovereignty, self-determination and free trade, government officials and legislators have devised a system whereby foreign governments are notified whenever a product is banned, deregulated, suspended or cancelled by an American regulatory agency. The notification system is handled by the State Department, whose policy statement on the subject reads in part. ""No country should establish itself as the arbiter of others' health and safety standards. Individual governments are generally in the best position to establish standards of public health and safety.""The main problems with notification is that other governments are generally not in a position to establish safety standards, let alone control imports into their countries. In fact, the countries where most of the U.S. banned and hazardous products are dumped lack regulatory agencies, testing laboratories or well-staffed customs departments.When domestic regulatory agencies find a product to be hazardous, they notify the State Department which in turn is supposed to send a communique to each American embassy overseas. Each embassy is then supposed to notify the appropriate foreign officials. However, the domestic agencies frequently neglect to inform the State Department when they ban a product. Further, even when the State Department was notified of a banned product, the communiques rarely went out of the U.S.Some foreign officials have complained that the communiques are vague and ambiguous, or else so highly technical that they are incomprehensible. Even if clear notification reaches officials in the importing nation, there is nothing to stop the exporters from chaning a product's brand name before they ship.Perhaps the only aspect of the whole dumping travesty that has kept the issue alive in Washington is reimportation. Hazardous products are being reimported (smuggled) into the U.S. for sale. And imported fruit and vegetables contain residue of presticide long since suspended for American use.","1981",0,0

Poulter told the Post that after learning the district faced a potential deficit of $4.6 million and had released four instructors from the East Bay Skills Center to save $150,000 in salaries, he projected that 120 faculty members would have to be cut for the district to balance the books.While board members agree the district is facing a hefty deficit and thay they are ""looking for ways to balance the budget"" at least one member, Curtis Aller of Berkeley, feels that faculty outs are the lowest priority in consideration. Aller said ""there are lots of other cuts we can make first."" However, with 80 percent of the district's budget going to salaries, some observers fear that a sizeable faculty cut is inevitable.Board member Kenneth Hoh, who is up for reelection'n April told the Post Tuesday that the boad had agreed in principal that 12 management positions would be cut, but there was disagreement as to whether the 26 recommended cuts in certificated teachers should be adopted. Hoh explained that the March 15 letters were a precautionary ""warning letter"" required by state law, advising faculty that their services may not be needed in the next year. Final notices of termination would go out subsequently on May 30.Hoh said that if the March 15 notices were not sent out then the district is legally obligated to retain and pay those employees for the rest of the year. He added though that employees stood a good chance of being rehired ""as soon as the financial picture got better.""But Poulter contends that the district is ""jumping the gun"" in even considering sending these notices. He said there was a statewide coalition of school boards and administrative organizations working on school, finance for the next year, and the outlook was optimistic.""Two years ago the Peralta Board of Trustees sent out March 15 layoff notices to approximately 30 faculty members,"" Poulter argued. ""All these notices were finally withdrawn but severe damage was done to faculty morale."" Poulter claims that at least one instructor who received a notice left teaching for a job in industry.Board member Booker T., Jackson, an unopposed incumbent in the coming elections, has been on the board for 10 years. He also feels that adjustments could be made in other parts of the budget.""We might encourage some early retirements,"" Jackson told the Post. He added that if as many faculty members as last year, 20, took leaves of absence, that would also affect the final number of instructors who would get layoff notices.Jackson said it would not be feasible to cut at the administrative level as Poulter has suggested. He pointed out certificated administators are tenured after three years, and since cuts are done by seniority a tenured administrator could automatically bump an instructor with less seniority.This approach was also of great concern to Hoh. He asserted that traditionally it has been the minority instructors and programs who get hurt by these cuts, since they were the last to enter the district. Hoh said that this also left ""productive instructors and programs"" open to being bumped by ""non-productive faculty"" who happen to have more senority. Hoh is hoping to initrate . . . that will allow the board to cut non-productive programs and faculty first, irrespective of tenure or seniority.","1981",0,1

"973","McDonald, Newt",1981-01-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Editor's Note--This is the first of a series on childcare and parenting which will appear in the Post weekend editions.Newt McDonald, director of a community-based childcare center in Berkeley, holds a Master's degree in Education from UCLA and is a childcare consultant. Post readers are encouraged to write to him c-o The POST with questions or suggestions for future columns.Finding adequate childcare is a necessity for most working parents with young children.Properly arranged, childcare is an asset to the family. Improperly arranged, is a headache to the parent, and a disservice to the child.Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to assure the best arrangements possible. Because of its importance, it pays for parents to invest a little extra time to find out what services are available, how to locate the right one, and how to make the proper arrangements.First, you will need to get a clear picture in your own mind as to what kind of childcare you need.Depending on the age of your child, you may be looking for infant care (0-2 years), preschool (3-5 years) or before-after school care (5-13 years). Of these groups, infant care is probably the most difficult to find.Some agencies provide only one type of service, while others provide for a combination of age groups. For families with more than one child, it may be convenient to find a program which serves multiple age groups.The next step will he to make a list of the things that are absolutely necessary for your needs. What about the days and hours required? Are there transportation or cost considerations? Does your child have special needs?Careful attention to these questions before going any further is a must. No service will be completely acceptable unless convenience, costs and special needs are thoroughly considered.Remember, any situation which puts additional stress on you and your family can be potentially bad.Let's talk about costs.Childcare is relatively expensive as a service and can take a big bite out of the family budget. In addition to the fees charged, you will also want to consider transportation and other related costs.Fees vary considerably, depending on the provider. Some homes and centers receive public money from the city county, state or social service agencies. These agencies will usually have a sliding fee scale with fees determined by family size and income. This is called subsidized care. Most private for business centers have set fees which are charged to all parents.Be sure to get a clear understanding (preferably in writing) about fees and payment arrangements before your child is enrolled.Next, add to the list the features that you want or over which you can exercise choice. Do you prefer a home or center? What about religious training? Maybe you already know a place.Generally, childcare is provided in a family day care home, a center or through a parent cooperative.Family day care homes are usually licensed to serve from 2-12 children in the operator-provider's own home. The advantage here is one of a home-like setting, smaller numbers of children and quite often a neighborhood location.Day care centers usually serve 10 or more children in small groups. Centers may offer a more varied program of learning activities, have credentialed staff, and may be slightly cheaper. In addition, some centers are affiliated with school districts which make them popular for after and before school care.For parents with time resources, cooperatives offer a flexible approach with parents sharing the work of taking care of the children. As child care goes, this is a relative luxury.At this point, it's a good idea to contact a resource and referral agency. These agencies have valuable information about lists of homes and centers, special programs and general advice. Local resource and referral agencies include the Oakland Licensed Family Care Association (phone; 658-2449), Berkeley Children's Services (phone: 549-3820), BANANAS, which serves both Oakland and Berkeley (658-0381), Richmond Childrens Council (233-KIDS), Child Care Switchboard in San Francisco (282-7858), and for Asian language referral in San Francisco call Wu Yee at 391-8993. One phone call can save you lots of time.Now that you've found out about the services available and have a list of agencies, there are important questions to be asked about quality. It's time to start checking out places.Things to look for in choosing childcare will be our next topic for discussion.","1981",0,0

It just isn't fair to any team. A game that figured to be a true test of the Raider defense against the Browns celebrated passing game ended being a struggle for survival for footing.In truth, the terrible field conditions probably hurt Cleveland more than it did Oakland. The Raider running game has not been that potent this year, and with Kenny King still hobbled with an ankle injury, Oakland didn't figure to do too much against one of the best defenses aginst the rush.On the other hand, the Browns who lived by the pass all year, found their receivers slipping, falling, dropping balls, and in general, without all their guns.Even so, Brian Sipe managed to give the Raiders some anxious moments, and almost pulled the game out of the fire. When it was all over, the game really came down to two COACH'S DECISIONS. The call by Tom Flores late in the fourth quarter, to go for the first down with inches to go on the twenty-nine yard line of the Browns, rather than try a field goal of 47 yards, could have made Tom the subject of much conjecture, had Cleveland won by a field goal later.As it turned out, Sam Rutigliano, Cleveland Head Coach, took Flores off the hook. There is no way to my mind that Brian Sipe should have chanced a pass from the Raider twelve yard line. John Brodie opined that the pass was surer than the field goal. Roger Stauibach thought the pass idea was good but that Sipe should have thrown the ball away when he saw the receiver covered.I agree with Terry Bradshaw. You don't take that kind of chance with the game on the line. If your kicker misses a 29 yard goal, at least you played it by the book. The Cleveland Coach will have all winter to thaw out and reflect on his decision, while the Raiders were steaming hot as soon as the game was over. You rarely expect some help from the opposing coach, the Raiders should send him a game check.....DALLAS BEATS A FINE ATLANTA TEAM...The other surviving WILD CARD managed I to beat a surprising well-balanced Atlanta team, and I was wrong. I said Dallas would win because Landry is a better coach than Leeman Bennett. The players won this one, and excellent, execution by the Cowboys, especially Danny White and Drew Pearson, were just too much for the Falcons.Dallas has been there fourteen of the last fifteen years, and that playoff experience pays off. You don't start counting your chickens until the final gun sounds. One thing seemed certain. Atlanta and Dallas have very porous pass defenses. Both starters at QB passed for over three hundred yards.","1981",0,0

There's new gear available that's almost compact enough to hide inside a lunch box.Some information on this gear from Popular Mechanics EncyclopediaTackle bagsPerhaps the best is a standard hard sided suitcase Sizes range from the 20-inch one suiter model to the largest three-suiter. Make your selection after laying out all gear you intend to take.Another bag is required when you reach your destination because a suitcase isn't the handiest thing to tote across a gravel bar or stow in a dugout canoe. You could take a pair of bags -- one packed with lures and the other full of spare fishing equipment clothing needed for the day and other accessories. Your tackle container must fold flat, should be waterproof, easy to carry and have an opening large enough to pack and unpack with ease. You might settle for an airline flight bag Select the large-size quality model most airlines now sell. It is well constructed of water-repellent nylon, and has good zippers and a shoulder strap.RodsThe greatest single contribution to travel tackle is the recent development of quality rods which disassemble and fit a suitcase. They eliminate the need for separate red containers and come in multisection pack rods or telescopic models. Over a dozen makers now offer a variety of portables that break down into neat bundles of 20 inches or less. Use care in selecting your travel rod. Some are light sticks designed for the back packer and may not stand travel abuse.Theoretically each time you insert a ferrule in a rod, you impair action and strength. But don't let anyone tell you that good five and six piece rods don't exist. Some anglers prefer solid glass ferrules to metal. The newer fiberglass joints have more flex which is important to action when five or six of them are involved.Telescopic rods now are growing popular again. Some low cost makes even seem to have fair action, but select carefully.Be particular about action as well. Today's ""wet noodle"" sticks, designed to cast light lures to small fish and make casting easier for beginners, are not versatile enough for take-along use. More backbone is required to handle different size lures so buy your travel rod with stiffer-than-normal action. Some anglers prefer the longer . . . handles to the new pistol grips. When you have a big tarpon on a handle you can grip with two hands is a real advantage.Berkley has a first-class eight-piece kit that makes into a casting spinning and fly rod in a choice of actions, plus three reels and extra line. Eagle Claw offers six-piece and eight-piece combinations, as do St. Croix and Martin. These suppliers as well as Orris, Heddon Fenwick and Gladding also offer combination spinning and fly-fishing outfits.ReelsPicking reels-to-go creates no problem if you select quality and take one or more spares in each category. To prevent travel damage pack them in sneakers or clothes, away from the bottom or sides of a suitcase. On arrival go over each reel to tighten huts and screws that might have vibrated loose during a flight.LuresTaking the right one is extremely important and because extra weight should be avoided knowing what to leave home is also important Separate lures by size, type of action and species of fish each attracts then stow them in durable plastic boxes.Flies are also separatted by type and size Big streamers can go in a special box when you plan some saltwatter fishing Bass bugs and wet and dry trout flies also rate separate containers.Larger casting and spinning lures require the real decisions and are separated into boxes of spoons, surface lures shallow running specials soft worms and grubbies jigs little heavyweight jigs and underwater wobblers divers and bottom scratchers Additional categories include jerk balls spinner baits, buzz baits, trolling rigs, saltwater feathers. special lures for tarpon and others. Various sized transparent plastic boxes would be best for lures but it's hard to find any that can take travel abuse. Meantime the opaque nonbrittle polypropylene boxes serve.Fishing acessoriesEvery fisherman's travel kit should also contain such spares as extra line wire leaders, sinkers, snap swivels pliers pocket scale reel oil, and repair items like extra guides thread tape a coil of light wire glue.

"980","",1981-02-15,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Music has been an integral part of the human experience since before recorded time. It is the language of sound which expresses all levels of the conditions under and into that which man was and is; and, as such, becomes a form of communication which fits the needs of the people who created it.Most early peoples attributed music to their gods, and the anonymous poets and singers can be said to have been music's first historians.In Genesis, the first Book of the Old Testament, Jubal, a relative of Cain, is said to be ""....the father of all such as handle the harps and organ."" Moses affirms this. The Greeks, through their legends and mythology, had a God and Goddess who ""invented"" music. Behind that ancient civilization came the Romans with their carbon copies.In the Sudan, the Dogans have eight kinds of drums, each a different size, which correspond to their interpretation of the creation of the world, from the birth of the great Monitor (God), symbolized by the Kunga drum; to the age when the human race began to increase and multiply--symbolized by the Barba drum. One might find an analogy in the Judeo-Christian interpretation of the Creation.Music and religion, then, have been intimately interwoven since the Dawn of Man.According to some eighteenth and nineteenth century Americans, culture in Africa was said to be non-existent; however, reports belie this. Before the African was brought to the New World as a slave, his musicality was well-developed and documented. The earliest published accounted was written by Richard Jobson, Esq. during a visit to Gambia in 1620-21. He observed the importance of music in the African's life, and stated that all ""....principall persons (that is, the kings and chiefs) do hold as an ornament of their state, so as when we come to see them, their musicks will seldome be wanting."" The important rulers employed their own bands and the bandmaster, master drummer and royal hornblower had the highest status. The better band members and singers were also held in high esteem, often receiving some form of gratuity from the dancers and visitors.An important member of every village was the bard. After having been identified as possessing possibilities for such a career, he served an apprenticeship of many years. His responsibilities were manifold. As chief historian, he related all information in song. Before a battle, he whipped the warriors into a frenzy with music, continuing on into the battle; constantly encouraging the troops with songs of the glorious deeds of their ancestors. He acted also as court jester, and often became the conscience of the ruler. Some became wanderers or itinerant minstrels and performed in religious ceremonies in addition to being the musical focus at social occasions. In the late eighteenth century, Olaudathe (Ibo) Equiano, one of the first Africans to write in English wrote;We are almost a nation of dancers, musicians and poets. Thus every great event...is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion.Various European writers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries corroborated this.Music, therefore was a functional part of each person's life from birth to death. The Ashanti, according to Bowdich, though it ""...absurd to worship God in any other way than with chanting or singing."" Music was used socially, recreationally, politically and, as stated earlier, as an act of communication. All chores, community involvements, human conditions, contracts, and expressions were manifested in this form. Each song had a specific motive for being instrumentalized, danced or sung.One of the earliest instruments on record, other than the drum, was the balafou or balafo, the forerunner of today's xylophone or marimba. Jobson carefully described it and remarked upon its unusual construction. Two gourds suspended from each key, afforded extraordinary resonance when this wooden slat (key) was struck by a stick swathed in ""...some soft stuff to avoid the clattering noise the bare stick would make.""Drums, of course, were the most important instrument and were indigenous to all communities or tribes. They were formed from hollowed out logs, gourds or calobashes, which were covered by stretched animal skins.","1981",0,0

Byrd's nomination was defeated by a vote of 6-5, Maloney said.Love was then approved by a vote of 8-2 with one abstention.Byrd, a black who had been with the school system for a number of years, was favored by many black groups in Chicago. Love, who is 48, is also black.Smith said details of the board's agreement with Love, including the amount of control she would have over the system's finances, would be made public later, according to Maloney.The issue of Love's financial control was a major sticking point in her negotiations with the board over the past 10 days.The Chicago school system has 458,497 students in 634 schools.In Oakland, Love has been in charge of 48,338 students in about 90 schools at a salary of $56,615.

OSU, the lone league team to win at home on Saturday, defeated Michigan while Indiana scored a 93-56 lopsided victory at Northwestern.That left four teams tied at 4-2 with three others -- Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan -- one game back at 3-3. Wisconsin defeated Illinois 54-45 at Champaign.Games Thursday pit Illinois at Michigan State: Minnesota hosting Indiana: Northwestern entertaining Michigan: Purdue at Iowa and Wisconsin at Ohio State.Minnesota Coach Jim Dutcher insisted his team's win over Iowa, wasn't an upset, but rather just another Big Ten game.""There is no such thing as an upset in this conference,"" Dutcher said. ""It's just as we advertise -- it's a great balanced league with some excellent teams.""Minnesota center Randy Breuer tallied nine of his 17 points in the second half to key the Gophers' win.Iowa Coach Lute Olson, whose team had won three straight Big Ten road games, said last Thursday's 56-53 win at Indiana affected his team's play.""I think I may have to describe (to Iowa players) which is our home court and which is the away court,"" Olson said. ""I've been concerned about this one ever since Thursday night.""The Purdue upset was engineered by Kevin Smith's 26 points and a team effort according to MSU Coach Jud Heathcote.""Smith gave us the lift offensively in the second half."" Heathcote said. ""But Rick Kaye and Ben Tower on the inside gave us excellent games.""Kaye, a 6-foot-7 senior forward, and Tower, a 6-foot-8 freshman forward, helped hold Purdue freshman center Russell Cross to eight points as Michigan State raised its conference record to 2-4 and overall mark to 8-7.""It wasn't that our team wasn't ready,"" explained Purdue Coach Gene Keady said. ""Just give them credit. They outplayed us.""Herb Williams was the hero in the OSU win, scoring 23 points and grabbing nine rebounds. He scored 17 points in the second half, when the Buckeyes rallied from a fourpoint deficit to take control of the game.""Williams is a great player,"" said Michigan Coach Bill Frieder, whose team fell to 3-3 in league play. ""When Ohio State decides to play, no team can beat them. They have the best front line in college basketball. We couldn't even get a rebound.""OSU Coach Eldon Miller also credited the second half defensive play of 6-9 Jim Smith on Michigan's Mike McGee with much of the Ohio State success. McGee finished with 21 points, but he had only one basket and eight points.Indiana out-muscled Northwestern and in the process sent the Wildcats to the league basement with a 1-5 mark. Isiah Thomas scored a season high 23 points in the victory.""That's the best game he's played this year. He dominated on both ends of the floor.

In these days of high costs and inflation, this can mean a substantial saving.The tax credit for child care applies to both the Federal and State income tax returns.As with other tax credits, the advantage is in being able to deduct expenses directly from the total amount of taxes paid. This means that after your total tax liability is computed, these expenses are deducted. Thus reducing the total amount of taxes to be paid.To be eligible for both the Federal and State credit you must be able to show that you have paid for child care in order to be able to work or to be able to look for work. In addition, the person for whom the services were provided must be a dependent of yours. (See IRS Publication No. 17 of the forms listed below for a definition of who can be counted as a dependent.)The dependent must be a child under 15 years of age, a spouse who is mentally or physically unable to care for himself or herself, or someone who can be listed as a dependent (or someone who could be listed as a dependent except that his or her income is $1,000 or more.) This includes a full-time student or a relative. In-laws and close relatives, but not cousins, are included.To apply for the Federal credit, use Form 2241 (Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses). It is also necessary to file the Form 1040, not the ""short form"" 1040A.The credit is generally 20 % of the total amount paid to the care provider up to a maximum of $2,000 for one child. For two or more children, the maximum is $4,000. In other words, the credit can amount to $400 for one child or $800 for two or more children.Allowable expenses include fees paid for the actual costs of services provided for care and/or household services.The only information required will be the name of the person or organization, the address, the amount paid and the period for which the credit is claimed. If the care provider is an individual (and this includes relatives), you will also need to include their social security number and their relationship to you, if any.Remember that if actual wages have been paid (for example, to a babysitter), any amount in excess of $50 per calendar quarter requires the filing of an employment tax return.The California State credit is filed on Form 3805X. The requirements and procedure will be the same as the Federal, with the following exceptions.-the maximum allowable California credit for one child is $60, for 2 or more children it is $120-California allows a maximum credit of 3% of employment related expenses-California does not allow a credit if the adjusted gross income is $20,000 or more. This applies to both single and joint returns filed.-the California credit must be reduced 2% for each $100 of adjusted gross income over $15,000If your adjusted gross income is less than $10,000 for the year and you are the head of a household with dependents, you may also be eligible for another Federal tax credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit.

It begins on Ash Wednesday, 40 days before Easter, excluding Sundays, and ends on Easter Sunday.Many Christians observe Lent by fasting, performing penancke, giving alms, abstaining from strong drinks and certain types of amusements. The season originated as one of spirituals preparation for Easter in remembrance of the passion death and resurection of Jesus Christ. It also symbolized the mourning of the Church, the bride for the departure of Christ, the bridegroom.This solemn period of the church offers many opportunities for spiritual growth. Our Lord emphasized the great significance in fasting not only in word but by example as well. His 40 days of fasting in the wilderness of temptation attest to this fact. By his humble sutmission to the Spirit he gained the spiritual power and moral courage necessary to endure all the great temptations of the world.","1981",0,0

She played 18 games for the Pioneers last season before being waived prior to the playoffs.Pate returns to the Pioneers after having been waived earlier in the season by then coach Frank LaPorte Pate, a rookie from Cal State-Los Angeles, finished her collegiate career as the team's second leading scorer (20.9 points per game).The Pioneers' current road trip began in Chicago, where they ran into a team that has just begun to find their potential. It was a game in which it seemd the ball was directed to the hoop by radar. When the dust had cleared at Alumni Hall the final score was the Hustle 143, Pioneers 116, record highs for both teams.In that game Molly Bolin was chosen the game's MVP by virtue of her 41-point performance, tying the record for the Pioneers. Anita Ortega had scored 41 points in a game last season.The following night the Pioneers had to play the tough Nebraska Wranglers. Nebraska, currently with the best record in the league (18-5), had the strength inside to muscle a 118-102 victory away from the Pioneers.Two nights later the Pioneers ventured to Dallas to take on the Diamonds minus Nancy Lieberman Although the Pioneers started out slow in the first half, they were only down by five at the intermission. The remainder of the game was nip and tuck the rest of the way with the Pioneers getting as close as two points behind with a little over two minutes remaining. However a few crucial calls that converted into three point plays for the Diamonds sealed the victory for the winners.Throughout the entire road trip the Pioneers' Molly Bolin has been shining. In those first three road games Bolin has scored 41, 32 and 35 points. Because of her efforts she was honored as the WBL Player of the Week, joining past recipients Nancy Lieberman, Carol Blazejowski and two-time player of the week Rosie Walker of the Nebraska Wranglers.Bolin's hot streak began on February 9 at the all-star game. In that contest Bolin scored 29 points to lead all scorers and power the West to a convincing 125-92 victory Since the all-star game Bolin has been averaging 36 points per game and has been the team's leading scorer for the last eight games.Bolin is currently fourth in the league's scoring race (24.6 ppg) and third in free throw accuracy (.828).The Pioneers will finish their current road trip in New Orelans on February 21. They will return home for a one-game homestand against the Dallas Diamonds on Friday, February 27.","1981",0,0

"993","Bresciani, Dennis",1981-03-04,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","Although 78-year-old Eliza Ashley lives by herself, she is never alone.Aside from the off and mostly on companionshp of 13 living children and over 100 grandchildren, a box attached to her telephone near her double bed serves as a constant companion and potential lifesaver.For Ashley, a widow afflicted with congested heart disease, the device known as ""lifeline"" serves as a potential life-saver 24 hours a day. At the push of a button, the device can-relay signs of trouble to a group of Merritt Hospital Nurses who constantly monitor Ashley's device and 11 others throughout the East Bay.Developed in 1975 by Andrew . . ., a Boston University professor, Lifeline was evaluated for three years by HEW which found in a sample of 200 aged and disabled that 80 percent used the device during a medical crisis, and another 20 percent found it useful in dealing with other problems, such as fire or police emergencies.The study also found that at least 33 percent of the emergencies Lifeline dealt with were falls in the home. Aside from the study by HEW, the device's mechanical workings were evaulated by the Veteran's administration.One of two Northern California hospitals using the device Merritt has offered the service to subscribers since October.Hospital officials say the device provides the elderly, living alone and beset with health problems, an alternative to convalescent home care. Lifeline may not provide the fastest response in comparison to the emergency numberr 911, but subscribers are assured of receiving the right help, according to Barbara Bacigalupi, Merritt public information spokesperson.A combination of existing technology, three components make up the device. One component, the automatic push button dialer functions on the assumption that a subscriber is unable to dial for help. Another component, a portable button worn on a subscriber's clothing can alert Merritt Hospital of possible emergencies as long as the device is within a 200 foot radius of the telephone.Lastly the device is equipped with a 12 or 24 hour timer device that automatically alerts Merritt if a subscriber is unable to contact Merritt through the portable switch. That feature eliminates the prospect of a person waiting for help for several days.When a subscriber activates Lifeline, nursing monitors stationed on Merritt's first floor are alerted by an alarm, according to Mary Crawford, emergency assistant head nurse. In addition, a tape inscribing the subscriber's card file number as well as a code number noting a possible emergency or the triggering of the automatic timing device is spit out of the control council.The monitors then look up the subscriber's medical file which notes the patient's name, address, phone number, doctor's name, address and phone number. In addition, medical history covering allergy to drugs and the names and phone numbers of three responders who can be contacted by Merritt to assess possible problems are noted.When summoned by Merritt to check on a subscriber, the responder's responsibility is to see what the situation is then tell the hospital. ""They act as intermediaries, not judgement makes,"" explained Mary O'Neal who through Merritt's social services department processes requests for Lifeline installations.Once the necessary information is forwarded to monitors by responders, the fire department, an ambulance or even the police can be called to the scene within minutes.Although a $10 charge covers equipment rental, maintenance and installation and 24 hour monitoring by Merritt, some subscribers such as Ashley obtain the services of Lifeline free, through the Multipurpose Senior Services Project (MSSP), an independent statewide program providing a variety of services to senior citizens.Usually a son or daughter of an elderly person who is ill and living alone contacts Merritt Hospital's social services department about the services, said O'Neal. Although the service is offered to the elderly who live alone and are ill, handicapped and temporarily disabled persons can take advantage of Lifeline.""I make an appointment to talk with them about their lifestyles. I talk with them about arrangements with neighbors to act as responders,"" O'Neal explained.On an average, if takes about seven days to get the device installed. In some cases a device can be installed before a subscriber returns home from a hospital visit.The ""crux of the program,"" according to one hospital spokesperson are the volunteers who install the devices, consult with subscribers then conduct monthly test calls.As the program progresses, ""the monthly calls by volunteers should develop a good raport with subscribers, noted John Guidici, a retired Oakland police officer who works as a Merritt and a Lifeline volunteer. As a Lifeline volunteer-Guidici tends the technical aspects of Lifeline such as the installation of the apparatus. When he installs the devices some subscribers are a bit awed by the technology involved, but a few minutes of explanation dispels any apprehension.One subscriber sold on Lifeline is Ashley. Besides providing her with the means to save her life, Lifeline provides peace of mind,"" Ashley told the Post.Ashley became a subscriber to Lifeline after sustaining a serious attack last December During the attack Ashley was unable to see the dial on the phone. Evenutally she was able to contact a granddaughter who summoned daughter Lercell Johnson--several hours after the first signs of life-threatening pains was felt.Had she had the device at her disposal. Ashley feels help would have arrived much sooner.Fortunately Ashley has not had to use the device. But the knowledge that it is in her bedroom working 24 hours a day probably accounts for her improved health, she suspects.Lercell and another daughter. Classie Terry feel at ease thanks to Lifeline. Although both daughters as well as a third daughter. Hazel Ashley, keep in contact with their mother job committments and the raising of families makes it difficult.Besdies allowing Ashley a sense of independence. Terry is able to continue working for the city of Oakland, thanks to Lifeline. ""I was considering quitting my job. I couldn't feel at ease working.""""I feel good about Lifeline.

Both are comedies with a ""message,"" aspiring to go beyond Sit-Comelandness, and both succeed only to a degree.""Shrinking Woman"" is a Lily Tomlintour de force, with Lily in the title role and in numerous other incarnations. The cameos are funny; her main role is not...unless the viewer happens to be a big Tomlin fan.Even as Lily appears in a scene, the film itself stands on a soap box. The story (""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" originally) is about the combined effect of chemicals in everything and everybody as exemplified by Lily's gradual disappearance. Joel Schumacher's direction is sluggish and the print looks fuzzy. The best thing in the movie is Rick Baker's wonderful, cuddy gorilla.""Melvin & Howard"" is a fine small picture. Unlike ""Shrinking Woman,"" it has long stretches of effective comic inspiration. For example, it offers a $39 de luxe Reno wedding (complete with the ""Hawaiian War Chant,"" no less) that should make most right-thinking folk fall of their seats in the theater.On the fact of it, ""Melvin & Howard"" is about the ""Mormon Will,"" the disputed and eventually discredited document that was to give millions of dollars to Melvin Dummar who once supposedly picked up a supposedly hitch-hiking supposed Howard Hughes on a Nevada road.

If we had a voice like his we'd make a million dollars in sales this year. The voice we're referring to is that of Harry Mills, lead singer with the Mills Brothers After 56 years you'd think the voice might be finished. But no, his voice is polished to a gentle glow. The opening night for the Mills Brothers at the Venetian Room in the Fairmont Hotel took us skillfully down the lazy river of time. And it was more than nostalgia. As the brothers did ""Basin Street Blues,"" which they had performed in radio's early days in the '20s, it felt like we were experiencing a part of the history of music that is solely American in origin. Perhaps they've done their songs thousands of times, but there was no sense of the ordinary or routine about them. The touching and sensitive renditions lifted the audience out of the hectic pace of contemporary life into a time when the pace was freer and more of the heart. For songs close to your heart, like. ""You Always Hurt The One You Love;"" ""Paper Doll;"" and ""Glow Worm;"" (to name a few they sang Wednesday night) take in the Mills Brothers. Herbert, Donald and Harry Mills have recorded over 1,300 songs. They still have a few left for you between now and Tuesday, March 3 closing night at the Venetian Room. The song, ""You Light Up My Life"", expresses the feeling one gets as Harry's voice glows over the hushed audience. As one listener said Wednesday night to Harry's statement, ""We have been singing for 56 year's,"" and they're still going strong. Now through March 3 at the Venetian Room in the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.NEW FOOD AND BEVERAGE MANAGER ... Frank J.

"997","Parker, Evelyn",1981-03-20,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","""Once upon a midnight dreary.""With these words Charles Pomerieau immediately captured the full attention of those who came to see ""Poe In Person,"" a one-man show. For not only was that popular line from ""The Raven"" written by Edgar Allen Poe, but Pomerleau bore a remarkable resemblance to Poe. Moreover, his voice held a hoarse, gutteral quality that Poe's, who oven overindulged, may have had.Deginning in Poe's 39th year (just a year before his tragic deach) is an excellent dramatic presentation Pomerleau's portrayal of Poe journeyed beyond mere acting. He allows himself to dig into Poe, the individual, and becomes an active reincarnation of the Poe spirit which is made complete by their uncanny resemblance.Poe is most often described as one who showed a suspicious interest in the consumption of alcohol, remained ill, and was preoccupied with the macabre Pomerleau, however, expounds on the other diverse subjects that held Poe's interest. For instance, Poe's marvelous sense of humor is portrayed in the silly parody, ""Lionizing"" -- a skit about the benefits of having a large nose.He also wrote what can be best described as spoken music, such as the lyrical piece. ""The Bells."" So entrancing was Pomerleau's rendition that it left the audience perched on the edge of their chairs, eyes wide and mouths gaping, grabbing for the elusive final words that hung momentarily, only to trail off into a . . . silence.The Julia Morgan Center was a fitting backdrop with its high beamed ceilings and completely wooden interior. The stage was adorned with only a table and oak chair The table was covered with . . . lace cloth and clustered upon it were a small brass lamp, a pitcher and mug of water and a photo or a women intended to symbolize Poe's constant mourning of his wife.In addition to ""The Raven."" Pomerleau performed""Annabell Lee."" ""The Bells,"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" which alone made the trip more than worthwhile Between each piece Pomerleau speaks in the first person, as though he actually were Poe. And it is during these snatches of exposition that little known facts are revealed. One each tidbit is that upon publishing ""The Raven."" Poe received a piddling eight dollars.That Poe was orphaned before he was three, had a number of people die on him (parents, step-parents and wife) and had a horrid experience in West Point are the more widely known characteristics of his life. But few know of the frustrations he experienced as a strugglling writer whose homeland was a country preoccupied with fortune hunting. The California Gold Rush was in full swing during the peak of Poes's career. He felt it dissatisfying that very few Americans had appreciation for his artistry. In Europe he was widely acknowledged, although, due to the absence of international copyright laws he received few European dollars.The one man show, which has been compared with Hal Holbrook's ""Mark Twain Tonight,"" has the same emotional intensity and was as spellbinding as James Earl Jones (PBS) portrayal of Paul Robeson. Neither a high school survey or a college English class preview comes near the effectiveness and thorough involvement one experiences with Charles Pomerleau Poe's look alike . . .Photo (Charles Pomerleau - Poe Look alike)","1981",0,0

"999","Hyman, Mac",1981-02-06,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","THE JOHN LUCAS CASE.....Make no mistake about it, John Lucas is not a Mike Ivy. While Mike has some real problems psychologically, according to what has been said by team officials, friends, etc., Lucas is another story.At this writing the Lucas matter is still up in the air. Supposedly the matter was to be handled by Warrior officials this week, and by now the whole thing may be yesterday's news.On the surface it would appear that John just can't handle the coming of Lloyd Free in particular, along with newcomers Bernard King, Joe Barry Carroll and any others that take the limelight away from one John Lucas.I say, ON THE SURFACE because there is a possibility that Lucas may be going through some kind of emotional upheaval of his own, and if that is the case the press should wait and see before ripping the guy apart a la J.R. Richard in Houston.From a personal observation, I can only relate the situation that existed from the time John Lucas arrived from Houston. When LUKE was the star of the game, and he had hordes of writers in front of his locker after the game, all was well. During the few games tht Purvis Short or Robert Parish had starred, Lucas was seen to mope around in the locker room.Here, I think, is the tip off as to what is bothering the little guard. This season, with the arrivial of the highly regarded draft pick, Carroll, the acquisition of Bernard King, and the coronation of ALL WORLD, Lloyd Free, Lucas was pushed far back in line for accolades.As a player, John Lucas is as good a point guard as most in the league. Assuredly there are those that are better, but LUKE could always get the job done. He is not a good shooter, and defensively he is definitely a liability. At approximately six feet Lucas gives away much height to the taller guards in the league, which makes his defensive limitations even more pronounced.However, with talent like King, Free and Carroll, Lucas could have a ball just driving the slot and dishing off to one of his team mates. On the occasion that he is left alone he could shovel up his specialty shot, and garner a few points of his own.Unfortunately, it seems that COOL HAND LUKE is just not unselfish enough to do that. Assists are very important to a team, and although they do not receive the press coverage as does scoring, they help to win games. Bob Cousy was a good shooter, but his real value was driving the opponents crazy with his amazing passes. The same thing is true of an ex-Warrior great, Guy Rodgers.I would think that John Lucas's days are numbered with the Warriors, but if the 27 year old Luke doesn't want to resume his career in tennis, he will have to adjust to not being a star every night, and give up the ball to those that can score.","1981",0,0
"1000","Best, Harry",1981-02-15,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","In the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area there are presently just three black-owned radio stations, KRE/KBLX. KJAZ, and KMPX. While these stations vary in style and appeal, they have one common element; other than black ownership, they all ofer Jazz music of one variety or another as the staple of their programming.Not so long ago these three stations were said to set the pace in standard and excellence for the rest of the industry with their progressive free-form style formats. However, as Bay Area audiences began to diversify as a result of cultural and social changes, these stations began to reflect the trends, in the loss of popularity and revenue.The following is a brief profile of recent developments at these stations and their plans to regain and control their share of the illusive radio market.When Inner City Broadcasting, a black New York-based company bought the Berkeley radio station KRE AM/FM back in April 1979, the station had no ratings with Arbitron (the Neilsen of the radio industry), and its audience, or lack of, was reflected in the gradual decline of revenue. No matter the station served out one of the best quality progressive music programs in the area, the business aspect of the operation lagged behind modern standards.Simulcasting pre-taped programs (to cut cost of deejay salaries) on both AM and FM bands over a 1,000 watt transmitter didn't quite do the trick. So it was with some degree of relief that the Horizon Broadcasting Company of New York agreed to sell the station.The new owners' plight was to bring the entire operation out of the dungeons of financial losses and obscurity, and into the competitive levels of production. However, in attempting this, management had to keep constantly in mind the positive attributes of the KRE broadcasting tradition that listeners enjoyed.The innovative approach was to retain the celebrated format of jazz, funk and fusion on AM and change the FM format to what station manager Oliver Sutton calls ""contemporary urban music."" Some say it's sophisticated R&B, but all it what you will, in less than three years the formula has catapulted the FM station, renamed KBLX, among the top 10 competitors in Arbitron estimates in the San Francisco market, with a 2.6 percent (audience market rating.""We thought it was best to separate the two, and give each its distinct character,"" Sutton says, ""We got back to live deejays 'round the clock, and upgraded our equipment for wider coverage.""Sutton says that KBLX's new format is aimed at attracting a broader audience. Arbitron demographics reflect that the station now draws an audience ranging in age from 18 to 55 years. Other figures also testify to the station's gradual increase in the percent of the market in the last two years. KRE on the other hand has maintained its traditional posture.Is management satisfied with the progress of the operations? Not yet.""We want to see these two stations become the best in the area. We think we have the talent, and we know we have the technology. It's just a matter of time,"" Sutton says.The new owners expect 1981 to be a good year for the company locally, but Sutton concedes it takes time to get credibility in the market. Hopes remain high however, as the station manager points out, ""your ratings always precede your revenue.""A new antenna on top of San Francisco's Russian hill, and a 50,000 watt transmitter, broadcasts the stations' signals as far south as Morgan Hill and to Santa Rosa in the north. The station now employs about 20 people.Sutton says that the Arbitron estimates are actually conservative when one considers that the majority of black listeners are not reflected in the surveys, since traditionally blacks do not respond to these surveys.The excitement that's buzzing around radio station KJAZ in Alameda these days has everything to do with the change in ownership last November. The present co-owners, Oakland Mayor Lionel J. Wilson and Real Estate Developer Ron Cowan, bought the operation from the original owner, Pat Henry, whose eccentricism was said to have stifled the creative elements in the station for the past three decades.Constant complaints by listeners to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about KJAZ's void of community service kept the statin steeped in controversy.Not unlike the KRE/KBLX financial situation, the station has been said to be losing revenue at the rate of $60,000 a month. The main problem according to Cowan was a lack of serious and modern techniques in marketing the product that this ""purveyor of only the best jazz"" is noted for.From its inception in 1959, this station was known for its classic taste in jazz programming -- from Benny Goodman to Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie. In the 60s, as jazz was overshadowed by insurgencies of Rock and Roll, KJAZ was an important factor in sustaining this indigenous musical tradition. However, as Jazz became more progressive the station was increasingly accused of stagnation. Once known as the best Jazz station in the country, KJAZ began to wane.Today the atmosphere at KJAZ is nothing short of electric.""There's more freedom now, more latitude, more excitement,"" Dick Conte, a veteran programmer with the station testifies. ""People here feel they can stretch out.""Conte disclosed a number of changes that the new management had outlined aimed at taking the station's ratings back to the top: Increased community involvement, features of local jazz musicians, remote broadcasts at local concerts, international jazz sessions plus morning traffic and weather reports. Part of the conditions imposed by the FCC in granting the license to the new owners was that they agree to broadcast three minutes of news for every 20 minutes on the air.According to Nancy Preiss, the public information person for the station, most of the planned improvements in programming were inspired by suggestions made in letters from supportive listeners.But the bottom line as far as new station manager Mike Day is concerned, is the revenue figures.""Our primary concern is to stem the tide of losses and meet our overhead,"" Day says.Although not yet registered with Arbitron, the station is said to maintain 1 to 1 1/2 percent of the audience market, comprised mainly of the executive, intellectual types. The listenership is also said to have a high percentage of black males.Badly in need of a promotional facelift, the station has revamped its sales department and commissioned the San Francisco advertising firm of Dancer/Fitzgerald/Sampson to work on the station's popularity. Day says that the new owners have not set any deadlines by which they expect to see a turn-around but he anticipates that changes will be evident in the revenue department in about six months.""We would like to see the station develop to a point of success that it is capable of being,"" Day says. ""We are working at optimizing our potential, while maintaining our integrity and capability as the Bay Area's exclusive source for pure jazz.""You don't have to be a nostalgia buff to listen to KMPX. As station manager Harvey Stone will tell you, people are into Big Band music because of what it is. ""It's a sound that's refreshing."" Traditionally this FM station had appealed to the 35-54-year-old age group in the upper income profile of executives, but with the recent resurgence of jazz music Stone says it's become ""hip"" for 25-34-year-olds who have become disillusioned with pop music, to turn to the music of the 30s and 40s.Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, the Dorsey Brothers, early Bing Crosby these are the types of music Stone says that ""allows people to escape reality."" Upbeat escapism, he calls it.Two-and-a-half years ago, the station was purchased by a black entrepreneur, Lloyd Edwards of the First Enterprise Bank. Edwards, who operates the station under the business named of Golden Gate Radio, wisely decided to retain the station's increasingly popular format. The new management has improved the programming by airing the exclusive Wall Street Report, an indispensable aid to area businesses and entrepreneurs.The station has maintained a traditional of broadcasting live from the Hyatt Regency Atrium Lobby each Friday, observing an increasing following of younger jazz buffs.Edwards says there are no plans to change the station's format but adds ""We're always trying to make what we have better.""The station employs about 20 people, has its antenna on the top of Mount Sutro in San Francisco and transmits with a power of 4,200 watts. It can be heard within a radius of 30 miles of San Francisco.In regards to black-oriented radio, it should be noted that radio station KDIA has by far the longest tradition of service to the black community, dating back almost 50 years. The station is owned by Viacom but employs black local management.Photo (Oliver Sutton, Station Manager at KRE/KBLX and part-owner of the New York-based Inner City Broadcasting.

The route goes from Los Angeles by way of Seattle to Helsinki. The flight from Los Angeles to Seattle takes 2 hours 25 minutes, and from Seattle to Helsinki 9 hours.The route will be flown once a week with DC-10-30 aircraft. Takeoff from Los Angeles is on Saturday night at 20.25, and arrival at Seattle at 22.50, takeoff for Europe from Seattle is at 23.40, and arrival in Helsinki is on Sunday afternoon at 17.40. For the flights to America the take off in Helsinki is on Saturday at 14.00, with arrival at Seattle at 14.30 local time. From Seattle the takeoff is at 16.00, with arrival in Los Angeles at 18.25.The flight schedule is designed to provide good connections from Helsinki for places elsewhere in Europe, and, on arrival in the American continent it is possible to fly from Seattle and Los Angeles to other places on the West Cost the same evening. Travel time from Los Angeles to Helsinki is cut by three hours, and from Seattle to Helsinki by four hours and a half, as compared with previous connections. On the globe Helsinki is the gateway on the route between Seattle and many countries in Europe. The shortest distant also means the lowest price.There has been a lot of ethnic travel between Finland and the West Coast, not only by charter flights but also including various stopovers. The Finnair organization has been developing group sales in America for over 10 years. Commercial ties with the West Coast have further developed in cargo and passenger volume in pace with travel for study, science, the arts, athletics and other interests. The possibility of profitable scheduled traffic now exists.As an alternative to the costly tourist class businessmen can choose the Business Class which has become popular of its in-flight entertainment and ground services on all Finnair's overseas routes. The standard of service in the first class is of renowned Chaine de Rotisseurs standard. The current extension work on the airport's passenger terminal and the airport hotel will improve the service standrd in Helsinki further.The West Coast route is a logical continuation of Atlantic scheduled traffic run by Finnair ever since 1969 with results that right now are among the foremost in interntional comparison. In 1979 more than 100,000 passengers were carried on the East Coast routes.WE MET FOUR FINE FINNAIR EXECUTIVES...During the press briefing in San Francisco a few months past, we had the pleasure of meeting some of the warm Europeans we all read about in magazines. We met Mr. Leif H. Lundstrom, general manager/North America; Mr. Y. Pekka Kurki, Director of Finalnd National Tourist Office; Mr. Borje Sandberg, assistant vice president, sales and Mr. Eric W. Ahlstrand, Manager-Western Division out of Los Angeles, if this all sounds like a good deal you can reach Mr. Ahlstrand in Los Angeles when Finnair flies from Los Angeles. Remember the new route starts May 16, 1981.TO GROW ONE MUST CHANGE... Or shall we say stay in step. And stay in step she did from the first homemade pie on Sacramento Street in Berkeley on December 1, 1955 to making hot biscuits at 60th and Adeline in North Oakland.

Well, you have been filling Lois the Pie Queen's restaurant for the past 26 years with standing room only. You've dined on scramble eggs, hot biscuits, grits, sausage or bacon, with coffee and many other items on the menu. We enjoy breakfast at Lois. The Pie Queen. If only sometimes the juke-box can be turned off for a little conversation to enjoy the beautiful dish. Now Lois is saving gumbo on weekends.

"1003","Hasan, Imam Mustafa",1981-01-11,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","(The third of a three part series)Greetings of Peace. As-Salaam-Alaikum.Dear Beloved People: This week we would like to reflect further on the steps needed to reconstruct the human family.The first step in reconstructing the human family is to reconstruct the individual human being. In order for the individual human being to be reconstructed, the human being must know him or herself. What have we been taught concerning ourselves? We have been taught that every human being that is born, in its nature, is formed and moulded to submit to the will and guidance of God. In the way of life, we call Al-Islam, the Arabic word used to describe the nature of one who submits his life to the guidance of God, is called Muslim. Therefore, every human being can say that our ownself is a righteous Muslim. This description of the human being we are taught through the Quran, the revelation brought through Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and through a collection of data called Hadith, which are the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. We are taught that all human beings are born Muslim by nature, and are changed only through the influences of the environment or by parental choices.The design of the human being in which everyone has been created, being influenced by environmental and parental choices, has to be studied, so that each person can of his or her own volition, come to know his or her self. We would like to call your attention to the importance of knowing the beginning of your creation and the purpose of your existence. God says about us, the human being, that we have been created in the best mould, in the most excellent design. Our form, our looks are excellent, good and beautiful. The life of the human being is a good life, when we follow God's guidance and direct our aspirations and actions towards living in the reality of good sense. As the human being learns through contrasts, discovery and has an emotional nature as well as an intellect and reasoning nature, the human being grows from instability to stability with truth and knowledge.The message of this article is for all concerned human beings, but in particular to the Bilalian or African-American people of the Bay Area. Most of the world does not know us by our personal names, they know us by our racial identity. A foolish people deprive the whole people of respect and dignity. A wise people can give a whole people respect and dignity. Because you are me, you are my community, you are my problem. You are me and I can't live without you. If you go down, you take me with you. In order for me to be sane, I have to identify with you. If I'm going to remain sane, I have to face the reality, and that reality is this: that a Bilalian (African-American) might be sitting on top of the world, but as long as the majority of the Bilalians are on the bottom of the world, no Bilalian is on top of the world!Dear Beloved people, please take a serious look at our condition as a people, and the environment that is our community, and the circumstances that afflict most of our lives. In order for us to change and improve ourselves and to make corrections we have to face and acknowledge the truth, even when it hurts. The Bilalian (African-American) community is a consumeroriented, pleasure-seeking, fragmented, and wasteful community upon which the materialistic community preys. The materialistic world needs you, and they have found a way into your hearts and into your minds.Therefore the masses of people are open to the exploitation of the materialistic world, mentally, physically and spiritually, both day and night.We only get a chance to reach into your hearts and minds, once in a while, to speak to you through articles such as this. We hope and pray that we can reach you, and hope that you are not hearing the words, tune and rhythms of the materialistic world, while we are talking to you. Look at this situation carefully, please. All day long they have you through the television, radio, record playing, through the magazine. Night and day, they reach you through the foolishness that they breed into the people around you. Up and down every street, we see little children, weighing seventy pounds, weighed down with a radio weighing 20 pounds, dancing on roller skates down the street. Even when the record player is off, they are still clowning. The song is still being sung.Dear beloved people, we have to have knowledge, we have to have conscience; we have to use good sense, if we want to survive and be respected. This world is designed through the t.v. tube and other means of media.","1981",0,0

He agreed it's like climbing a mountain you do so because it's there.As for reports that a cool reception from opponents awaits Love and Mitchell when they arrive in Chicago, the deputy superintendent said, ""I'm sure the majority of the community is not hostile toward Ruth Love or Chuck Mitchell. Those concerned about the process of education will receive us well.""Some Chicago citizens reportedly preferred an administrator from within the district.""Things will work out once we know the people there. Most people are good at heart,"" he added.With the departure of Mitchell set for February 27, the board must select an interim superintendent by then.

"1007","Berkley, Gail",1981-02-01,"Oakland Post (1968-1981)","The seven directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility District have a court date, February 9, following a unique lawsuit filed Monday by the lone black member of the EBMUD board.Director Kenneth Simmons sued his six fellow board members in an attempt to stop the hiring of Jerome Gilbert as the district's general manager. Simmons charged that the selection process used violated the district's affirmative action guidelines.""As a taxpayer in the EBMUD district and as a duly elected Director of EBMUD with a duty to uphold the public trust,"" Simmons said last week, the selection was made following a ""flawed process that did not conceivably turn up all possible minority candidates.""The suit filed Monday sought a temporary restraining order against the hiring of Gilbert, who is white. Judge Robert Kroninger ruled against the restraining order but ordered the directors to appear in court February 9 on the charges.The district is charged in its affirmative action guidelines adopted in July 1975 to ""provide equal opportunity for all persons in all aspects of employment"", including recruitment and hiring, and to ""rapidly overcome the underutilization"" of members of minority groups in all job categories and at all levels throughout the District.""On Tuesday the board met in executive session, and voted without Simmons' participation to pursue negotiations with Gilbert to replace retiring John S. Hannett.A water industry consultant from. Sacramento, Gilbert was formerly general manager of the North Marin County Water District and board chairman of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.Gilbert was selected by the board as the principal candidate for the $65,000 a year position from among nine finalists supplied to the board by the executive search firm Korn-Ferry International, according to John Q. Reynolds, EBMUD board president. Reynolds said two minority candidates were among the nine finalists interviewed for the position.Simmons maintains, however, that although when hired Korn-Ferry was specifically told by the board to ""conduct a thorough search to turn up qualified minority candidates,"" at least three qualified minorities were overlooked.When interviewed by Korn-Ferry last year, Simmons said he gave them the name of a black, Elijah Rogers, former city manager in Berkeley and currently municipal administrator of the District of Columbia, as a possible candidate.""They assured me that he was part of their network and they were frequently in touch with him,"" Simmons said.Six months later, Simmons said. Korn-Ferry reported to the board they had contacted approximately 111 people. ""Forty-four of these were interested in the position and 68 were not.""""They had not contacted Mr. Rogers at all to see if he was interested, or to get names of other possible qualified minority candidates.""In December, Simmons said he contacted Rogers who indicated he was interested in the position but had not been contacted. Rogers also gave the names of two other black managers whom he knew to be qualified for the postion, neither of them had been contacted by Korn-Ferry, Simmons said.""Apparently of 111 persons contacted only one was minority and that name was in fact given to them by another board member, Simmon's said.Reynolds Wednesday defended Korn-Ferry and the board, saying, ""We spent many hours and many days in the selection and interviewing process, and affirmative action aspects of selection were always in our minds.""In a related matter, the EBMUD Black Employees. Association last week adopted a resolution strongly supporting Director Simmons' efforts to make affirmative action more of a reality at EBMUD.""","1981",0,1
