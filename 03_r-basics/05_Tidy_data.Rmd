* I adapted the following content from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), his [earlier paper](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) published in the Journal of Statistical Software, and [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) by Gillespie and Lovelace.

- The big picture 
    - Tidying data with **tidyr**
    - Processing data with **dplyr**

# 1. What're tidy principles 

## 1. The dataset: strucure (physical layout) + semantics (meaning)

### 1.1. Data structure 

* rows and columns 

### 1.2. Data semantics

* variables > values (numbers or strings)

## 2. Tidy tada: "provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset."

### 2.1 Tidy principles 

* 1. Each variable forms a column.
* 2. Each observation forms a row.
* 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r}

# load library
library(tidyverse) 

# tidy data example 
table1

```

Practically, this approach is good because you're going to have consistency in the format of data across all the projects you're working on. Also, tidy data works well with key packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2) in R.

Computationally, this approach is useful for vectorized programming because "different variables from the same observation are always paired".

## 3. Messay datasets 

### 3.1. Signs of messy datasets 

* 1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
* 2. Multiple variables are not stored in one column.
* 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
* 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
* 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

## 4. Tidy tools 

Either input or output or both of them can be messy. Tidy tools can fix these problems. 

### 4.1. Tidyr manipulation (organizing)

#### 4.1.1. Gather (from wide to long)

```{r}

table4a

# from long to wide 
table4a %>%
  gather('1999', '2000', key = "year", value = "population")

# save the file 
table4a_wide <- table4a %>%
  gather('1999', '2000', key = "year", value = "population") 

```

#### 4.1.2. Spread (from wide to long)

```{r}

table4a_wide %>%
  spread(key = "year", value = "population")

```

#### 4.1.3. Separate (split one into many columns)

```{r}

table3

table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases" , "population"))

table3_separated <- table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases" , "population"))

```


#### 4.1.4. Unite (multiple columns into one column)

```{r}

table3_separated %>%
  unite(rate, cases, population)

```

### 4.2. dplyr manipulation (process)

dplyr is better than the base R approaches to data processing:

- fast to run (due to tis C++ backend) and intuitive to type
- works well with tidy data and databases

There are so many useful commands that come from dplyr: filter(), slice(), arrange(), select(), rename(), distint(), mutate(), summarize(), sample_n().

The pipe operator %>% origianlly comes from the magrittr package. The idea behind the pipe operator is [similar to](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial) what we leanred about chaining functions in high school. f: B -> C and g: A -> B can be expressed as $f(g(x))$. Basically, the pipe operator chains operations. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder) # load gapminder package

gapminder # the data is already organized by tidy principles 

names(gapminder) # the column names 
  
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% # filter by Europe
  group_by(country) %>% # group by country 
  summarize(Mean = mean(gdpPercap)) %>% # collapse data by mean 
  top_n(5, Mean) %>% # count only top 5 by mean 
  arrange(desc(Mean)) # arrange by descending order

gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  rename(population = pop) # rename pop variable (old name = new name) 

gapminder$pop # It should be NULL
```


### 4.3. Modeling 

Will not be extensively covered in this course.

### 4.4. Visualization

Will be covered in the future session.
