**Computational Tools and Techniques for Social Science**

This course will provide graduate students the technical skills necessary to conduct research in computational social science. This course will help students to develop proficiency with computational tools and techniques. Mastering these tools and techniques not only enables students to collect, wrangle, analyze, and interpret data easier and faster, but it also let students to work on research projects that would previously seem impossible. 

The course is currently divided into two main subjects (fundamentals and applications) and six main sessions. 

**Fundamentals**
* In the first section, students learn best practices in data and code management using Git and Bash. 
* In the second, students learn how to wrangle, model, and visualize data easier and faster. 
* In the third, students learn how to use functions to automate repeated things and develop their own data tools (e.g., packages). 

**Applications**
* In the fourth, students learn how to collect and parse semi-structured data at scale (e.g., using APIs and webscraping). 
* In the fifth, students learn how to analyze high-dimensional data (e.g., text) using machine learning. 
* In the final, students learn how to access, query, and manage big data using SQL.

## PS239T 2.0 is coming 

I will be offering PS239T in Spring 2021 and am developing the next version of the course (PS239T 2.0). The tentative course structure is outlined below. The online book version of the course materials will be also available soon.  

### Dashboard 

You can follow the course development process [here](https://github.com/jaeyk/PS239T/projects/1).
