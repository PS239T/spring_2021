# Objectives

- Understand the intuition behind the *Grammar of Graphics*
- Gain familiarity with visualization implementation in `ggplot2`
- Use customizable thematics to make beautiful figures

---

# The problem with base graphics

- They're just plain ugly
- Syntax and code is not intuitive
- Figures are difficult to manipulate
- Insufficiently modular

---

# The beauty of `ggplot2`

- Can easily create beautiful data visualizations with few lines of code, often publication worthy
- Syntax and code is highly modular
- Relies on a logic of `aesthetics` which allows users to communicate tons of information in a single figure
- Readily integrated with the other tools of the `tidyverse`

# How does `ggplot2` work? The grammar

- As a general rule of thumb, visualized data is more powerful and more compelling than tabular presentations.
- `ggplot2` is based on the principles of Leland Wilkinson's *Grammar of Graphics* book.
- In principle, the point is to think about the different features of a graphic as *layers*
 * data
 * aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size)
 * geometric objects (points, lines, bars)
 * stats (summaries)
 * scales (mapping values to the data space)
 * coordinates
 * facetting

# How does `ggplot2` work? The workflow

## Step 0 -- Pre-processing

1. Tidying data

## Step 1 -- Building the Frame

2. Mapping the data through `aes`. Here, we are telling `ggplot2` which variables should be represented by which visual elements (x, y, size, color) in the plot

3. Shaping the data with `geom_`. Here, we are telling ``ggplot2` which type of visualization we want to use. (`geom_point`, `geom_histogram`, `geom_density`, `geom_boxplot`, `geom_bar`, `geom_line` )

4.	Corordinates and scales
  
## Step 2 -- Interior Design

5. Labels and guides

6. Themes

# How does `ggplot2` work? An example

```{r, echo = T}

life_exp_gdp <-
  country_data %>%
  filter(year > 1900, year < 2020) %>%
  filter(country %in% c("India", "Indonesia", "France", "Belgium", "Argentina", 
                        "Italy", "Chad", "Iran", "Brazil", "Germany"))

glimpse(life_exp_gdp)
```

---
# How does `ggplot2` work? `geom_line`

```{r, echo = T, fig.height=4,fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}

ggplot(data = life_exp_gdp,
       mapping = aes(x=year, y = life_expect, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 1900, to = 2020, by = 10))
 
```
---

# How does `ggplot2` work? `geom_point`

```{r, echo = T, fig.height=4,fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}

ggplot(data = life_exp_gdp,
       mapping = aes(x=gdppc, y = life_expect, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "GDP per capita",
    y = "Life expectancy"
  )
```

# An extended example using California elementary school data

- Access data through one of two paths:
- It's included in the package `AER`. You can install this package and the dataset `CASchools` will automatically be available in R. Just call `data("CASchools")`.
- I've also downloaded the data and saved it as a .csv on the github repo for this week's lecture. You can access it under lecture_notes >> week5 >> data >> `california_schools.csv`.
