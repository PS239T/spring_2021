# PS239T

Welcome to PS239T

___

This course will help social science graduate students to think computationally and develop proficiency with computational tools and techniques, necessary to conduct research in computational social science. Mastering these tools and techniques not only enables students to collect, wrangle, analyze, and interpret data with less pain and more fun, but it also let students to work on research projects that would previously seem impossible.

The course is currently divided into two main subjects (fundamentals and applications) and six main sessions. 

**Part I Fundamentals**

- In the first section, students learn best practices in data and code management using Git and Bash. 

- In the second, students learn how to wrangle, model, and visualize data easier and faster. 

- In the third, students learn how to use functions to automate repeated things and develop their own data tools (e.g., packages). 

**Part II Applications**

- In the fourth, students learn how to collect and parse semi-structured data at scale (e.g., using APIs and webscraping). 

- In the fifth, students learn how to analyze high-dimensional data (e.g., text) using machine learning. 

- In the final, students learn how to access, query, and manage big data using SQL.

# Managing data and code {#Intro}

## Project-oriented research

### Computational reproducibility

#### Setup


```r
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # tidyverse
  here # computational reproducibility
)
```

#### Motivation 

Why do you need to make your research project computationally reproducible?

For your self-interest and public benefits. 

![](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/efficient-reproducible-project-management-in-R/blob/master/misc/screenshot.png?raw=true)

#### How to organize files in a project 

You won't be able to reproduce your project unless it is efficiently organized. 

Step 1. [**Environment**](https://environments.rstudio.com/) is part of your project. If someone can't reproduce your environment, they won't be able to run your code.

- Launch R Studio. Choose Tools > Global Options. You should not check `Restor .RData into workspace at startup` and set saving workspace option to `NEVER`.

Step 2. For each project, create a project directory named after the project. 


```r
# Don't name it a project. Use a name that's more informative. For instance, us_election not my_project.

dir.create("../us_election")
```

Step 3. Launch R Studio. Choose File > New project > Browse existing directories > Create project This allows each project has its own workspace. 

Step 4. Organize files by putting them in separate subdirectories and naming them in a sensible way.

- Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!) and put in the `data` directory.


```r
dir.create(here::here("us_election", "data"))
```

- Separate read-only data from processed data and put in the `processed_data` subdirectory.


```r
dir.create(here::here("us_election", "processed_data"))
```

- Put your code in the `src` directory. 


```r
dir.create(here::here("us_election", "src"))
```

- Put generated outputs (e.g., tables, figures) in the `outputs` subdirectory and treat them as disposable.


```r
dir.create(here::here("us_election", "outputs"))
```

- Put your custom functions in the `functions` subdirectory. You can put some of them together later as a package. 


```r
dir.create(here::here("us_election", "functions"))
```

**Challenge 2**

Set a project structure for a project named "starwars". 

#### How to organize code in a R markdown file 

- In addition to environment, **workflow** is an important component of project efficiency and reproducibility. 

- R Markdown basic syntax 


```r
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

- Use these section headings to indicate workflow.


```r
# Import packages and data
# Tidy data
# Wrangle data
# Model data
# Visualize data
```

- Press `ctrl + shift + o`. You can see a document outline based on these headings. This is a nice feature for finding code you need to focus. 

- If your project's scale is large, then divide these sections into files, number, and save them in `code` subdirectory. 

   - 01_wrangling.Rmd
   - 02_modeling.Rmd 
   ... 

#### Making a project computationally reproducible

- `setwd()`: set a working directory. 

- Note that using `setwd()` is not a reproducible way to set up your project. For instance, none will be able to run the following code except me.


```r
# Set a working directory 
setwd("/home/jae/starwars")

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()
ggsave("./outputs/example.png") # This is called relative path 
```

- Instead, learn how to use `here()`'.

   - Key idea: separate workflow (e.g., workspace information) from products (code and data). For more information, read Jenny Bryan's wonderful piece on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).

   - Example 


```r
# New: Reproducible 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

ggsave(here("project", "outputs", "example.png"))
```

   - How `here` works 

   `here()` function shows what's the top-level project directory. 


```r
here::here()
```
   - Build a path including subdirectories 


```r
here::here("project", "outputs")
           #depth 1   #depth 2
```
   - How `here` defines the top-level project directory. The following list came from [the here package vignette](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)).

      - Is a file named .here present?
      - Is this an RStudio Project? (**Note that we already set up an RStudio Project!** So, if you use RStudio's project feature, then you are ready to use `here`.)
      - Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?
      - Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named `remake.yml`?
      - Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named `.projectile`?
      - Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named `.git` or `.svn`? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.

      - If there's no match then use `set_here()` to create an empty `.here` file. 

**Challenge 1**

1. Can you define computational reproducibility? 
2. Can you explain why sharing code and data is not enough for computational reproducibility? 

### Version control (Git and Bash)

![](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BashGit/raw/master/octobash.png)

#### What Is Bash?

##### Writing your first shell script 

Write a shell script that creates a directory called `/pdfs` under `/Download` directory, then find PDF files in `/Download` and copy those files to `pdfs`. This shell script creates a backup.

```bash

#!/bin/sh

mkdir /home/jae/Downloads/pdfs 

cd Download

cp *.pdf pdfs/ 

echo "Copied pdfs"

```

#### What Are Git and GitHub?

![Figure 2.1. A schematic git workflow from Healy's "The Plain Personâ€™s Guide to Plain Text Social Science"](https://plain-text.co/figures/git-basic.png)

##### Basics: `git push` and `git pull`

##### Time machine: `git revert` 

##### Parallel universe: `git branch`

##### User-manual: `readme`

- README.md 

![](https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/125446/images/README_Sample.png)

- In this simple markdown file, note some basic information about the project including the project structure.

- This is how I used the `README.md` file for this course. Check out [my GitHub account](https://github.com/jaeyk) to see how I manage my projects.

#### Deployment: GitHub Pages 

#### Tracking progress: GitHub Issues 

#### Project management: GitHub Dashboards

## Writing code: How to code like a professional

### Write readable code

- What is code style?

> Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style. - [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) 

- Files 
- When naming files:
    - Don't use special characters. (Spaces make filenames awkward in the console/command-line.)
    - Don't capitalize. (UNIX is case sensitive.)
    - Numbering them if files should be run in an order.


```r
# Good
fit_models.R

# Bad
fit models.R
```

- Objects
- When naming objects:
    - Don't use special characters.
    - Don't capitalize.


```r
# Good 
day_one
    
# Bad 
DayOne
```

- Functions 
- When naming functions:
    - Don't use special characters.
    - Don't capitalize.
    - Use `verbs` instead of `nouns`. (Functions do something!)
    

```r
# Good 
run_rdd 

# Bad 
rdd
```
    
- Spacing 


```r
# Good
x[, 1] 

mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) 

# Bad

x[,1]

mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- Indenting 


```r
# Good
if (y < 0) {
  message("y is negative")
}

# Bad
if (y < 0) {
message("Y is negative")}
```

- Long lines


```r
# Good
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires = many, arguments =
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

- Comments 
   - Use comments to explain your decisions. 
   - But, show your code; Do not try to explain your code by comments.
   - Also, try to comment out rather than delete the code that you experiment with. 


```r
# Average sleep hours of Jae
jae %>%
  # By week
  group_by(week) %>%
  # Mean sleep hours 
  summarise(week_sleep = mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Pipes (chaining commands)


```r
# Good
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  gather(measure, value, -Species) %>%
  arrange(value)

# Bad
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarize_all(mean) %>%
ungroup %>% gather(measure, value, -Species) %>%
arrange(value)
```

- Additional tips 

- Use `lintr` to check whether your code complies with a recommended style guideline (e.g., `tidyverse`) and `styler` package to format your code according to the style guideline.

![how lintr works](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cb80270269165a8d3046d2da03cbf2b8f19ee2f/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f61635632374e562e676966)

### Write reusable code 

- Pasting 

> Copy-and-paste programming, sometimes referred to as just pasting, is the production of highly repetitive computer programming code, as produced by copy and paste operations. It is primarily a pejorative term; those who use the term are often implying a lack of programming competence. It may also be the result of technology limitations (e.g., an insufficiently expressive development environment) as subroutines or libraries would normally be used instead. However, there are occasions when copy-and-paste programming is considered acceptable or necessary, such as for boilerplate, loop unrolling (when not supported automatically by the compiler), or certain programming idioms, and it is supported by some source code editors in the form of snippets. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-and-paste_programming) 

- It's okay for pasting for the first attempt to solve a problem. But if you copy and paste three times (a.k.a. [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) in programming), something's wrong. You're working too hard. You need to be lazy. What do I mean and how can you do that?

- Example 

- Let's imagine `df` is a survey dataset. 

    - `a, b, c, d` = Survey questions 

    - `-99`: non-responses 
    
    - Your goal: replace `-99` with `NA` 
    

```r
# Data

set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility 

df <- tibble("a" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "b" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "c" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "d" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE))
```


```r
# Copy and paste 
df$a[df$a == -99] <- NA
df$b[df$b == -99] <- NA
df$c[df$c == -99] <- NA
df$d[df$d == -99] <- NA

df
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 4
##       a     b     c     d
##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
## 1     3     3     3     1
## 2     3     2     3     1
## 3     1    NA     1     2
## 4     1    NA     2     1
## 5    NA     1     1     3
```

- Using a function 
   - function: input + computation + output 
   - If you write a function, you gain efficiency because you don't need to copy and paste the computation part. 


```r
# Create a custom function
fix_missing <- function(x) { # INPUT
  x[x == -99] <- NA # COMPUTATION
  x # OUTPUT 
}

# Apply the function to each column (vector)
# This iterated part can and should be automated.
df$a <- fix_missing(df$a)
df$b <- fix_missing(df$b)
df$c <- fix_missing(df$c)
df$d <- fix_missing(df$d)

df
```

- Automation
   - Many options for automation in R: `for loop`, `apply` family, etc. 
   - Here's a tidy solution comes from `purrr` package.
   - The power and joy of one-liner. 


```r
df <- purrr::map_df(df, fix_missing) # What is this magic? We will unpack the blackbox (`map_df()`) later.

df
```

- Takeaways

  1. Your code becomes more reusable, when it's easier to **change, debug, and scale up**. Don't repeat yourself and embrace the power of lazy programming. 
  
  2. Only when your code becomes **reusable**, you would become **efficient** in your data work. Otherwise, you need to start from scratch or copy and paste, when you work on a new project.

> Lazy, because only lazy programmers will want to write the kind of tools that might replace them in the end. Lazy, because only a lazy programmer will avoid writing monotonous, repetitive codeâ€”thus avoiding redundancy, the enemy of software maintenance and flexible refactoring. Mostly, the tools and processes that come out of this endeavor fired by laziness will speed up the production. -  [Philipp Lenssen](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html)
